METHODS: A total of 1000 informal caregivers, recruited offline, participated in a cross-sectional online survey from April 21 to May 2, 2020. Questionnaires were used to assess COVID-19-specific changes in the care situation, negative feelings in the care situation, problems with implementation of COVID-19 measures, concerns/excessive demands, loss of support, change in informal caregivers’ own involvement in care and problems with provision, comprehension & practicability of COVID-19 information, and to relate these issues to five indicators of care involvement (i.e., being the main caregiver, high expenditure of time, high level of care, dementia, no professional help). Binomial and multiple regression analyses were applied. RESULTS: Across indicators of care involvement, 25.5–39.7% reported that the care situation rather or greatly worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for those caring for someone with dementia or those usually relying on professional help. In a multiple regression model, the mean number of involvement indicators met was associated with age (β = .18; CI .10–.25), excessive demands (β = .10, CI .00–.19), problems with implementation of COVID-19 measures (β = .11, CI .04–.19), an increase in caregiving by the informal caregivers themselves (β = .14, CI .03–.24) as well as with no change in the amount of caregiving (β = .18, CI .07–.29) and loss of support (β = −.08, CI −.16–.00). No significant associations with the mean number of involvement indicators met were found for gender, educational level, change in the care situation, negative feelings, and provision, comprehension & practicability of COVID-19 information.

Most animal models that investigate this effect are based on prolonged isolation, which does not mimic the milder conditions experienced by people in the real world. We show that in adult male rats, acute social isolation causes social memory loss. This memory loss is accompanied by significant changes in the expression of specific mRNAs and proteins in the medial amygdala, a brain structure that is crucial for social memory. These changes particularly involve the neurotrophic signaling and axon guidance pathways that are associated with neuronal network remodeling. Upon regrouping, memory returns, and most molecular changes are reversed within hours. However, the expression of some genes, especially those associated with neurodegenerative diseases remain modified for at least a day longer.

Although chest X-rays are the initial imaging technique of choice for low respiratory infections with or without dyspnea, few articles have reported the radiologic findings in children with COVID-19. Objective To describe the clinical, laboratory, and chest X-ray findings in pediatric patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection attended at our hospital in March 2020. To analyze the frequency of COVID-19 compared to other respiratory infections, and to describe the radiologic manifestations of COVID-19 in pediatric patients. Material and methods This cross-sectional observational study included all children with clinical manifestations of respiratory infection (fever, rhinorrhea, cough, and/or dyspnea) that required chest X-rays in our hospital between March 1 and March 31. Results A total of 231 pediatric patients (90 (39%) girls and 141 (61%) boys; mean age, 4 y, range 1 month – 16 years) underwent chest X-rays for suspected respiratory infections. Most (88.4%) had mild symptoms; 29.9% had a family member positive for COVID-19 with symptoms similar to those of the patient. Nasal and/or throat swabs were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 with PCR in the 47 (20.3%) children who presented at the emergency department; 3 (6.3%) of these were positive. Microbiological analyses were done in 85 (36.8%) of all patients, finding infections due to pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2 in 30 (35.3%). One of the patients with a PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 had urine infection due to E. coli and blood culture positive for S. viridans. Abnormalities were observed on X-rays in 73.2% of the patients. Peribronchial thickening was the most common abnormal finding, observed in 57% of patients. Parenchymal consolidations were observed in 38.5%, being bilateral in 29.2% and associated with pleural effusion in 3.3%. The interstitial lines were thickened in 7.3%, and 7.3% had ground-glass opacities. Conclusion During March 2020, COVID-19 and other symptomatic respiratory infections were observed. The radiologic pattern of these infections is nonspecific, and chest X-rays alone are insufficient for the diagnosis. Children with clinical manifestations compatible with COVID-19 (with or without PCR confirmation of infection by SARS-CoV-2) had mild symptoms and most did not require admission or invasive mechanical ventilation. In a context of community transmission, the absence of a known epidemiological antecedent should not be a contraindication for PCR to detect SARS-CoV-2.",2021-02-12,"Aguirre Pascual, E.; Coca Robinot, D.; Gallego Herrero, C.; Navallas Irujo, M.; Rasero Ponferrada, M.; Pont Vilalta, M.",,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/fda7d8f413e696910dc52a807cdbb2987cbdd956.json,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2173510721000318?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2173510721000318,231884724.0

SMS text message vaccine reminders are effective, but less is known about the best types for HPV series completion or the ability to assess and target vaccine decision-making stage. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of HPV vaccine series completion in minority adolescents who received precision and educational versus conventional SMS text message reminders. METHODS: Enrolled parents of adolescents aged 9-17 years who received the first HPV vaccine dose at 1 of the 4 academic-affiliated community health clinics in New York City were randomized 1:1 to 1 of the 2 parallel, unblinded arms: precision SMS text messages (which included stage-targeted educational information, next dose due date, and site-specific walk-in hours) or conventional SMS text messages without educational information. Randomization was stratified according to gender, age, and language. The primary outcome was series completion within 12 months. In post hoc analysis, enrollees were compared with concurrent nonenrollees and historical controls. RESULTS: Overall, 956 parents were enrolled in the study. The precision (475 families) and conventional (481 families) SMS text message arms had similarly high series completion rates (344/475, 72.4% vs 364/481, 75.7%). A total of 42 days after the first dose, two-thirds of families, not initially in the preparation stage, moved to preparation or vaccinated stage. Those in either SMS text message arm had significantly higher completion rates than nonenrollees (708/1503, 47.1% vs 679/1503, 45.17%; P<.001). Even after removing those needing only 2 HPV doses, adolescents receiving any SMS text messages had higher completion rates than historical controls (337/2823, 11.93% vs 981/2823, 34.75%; P<.001). A population-wide effect was seen from 2014 to 2016, above historical trends. CONCLUSIONS: SMS text message reminders led to timely HPV vaccine series completion in a low-income, urban, minority study population and also led to population-wide effects. Educational information did not provide an added benefit to this population.

In this context, conditions typical of low-resource settings surfaced also in high-resource ones (e.g., the lack of essential medical equipment, of resources etc.), while exacerbating in the already resource-scarce settings, because of COVID-19. This is the case of oxygen concentrators that are one of the first-line medical devices for treating COVID-19 patients. Since the beginning of 2020, their demand has been rapidly growing worldwide, aggravating the situation for low-resource settings, where the availability of devices providing oxygen-enriched air was already scarce. In fact, due to their delicacy, the lack of spare parts and of an appropriate health technology management system, oxygen concentrators can often be found broken or not working properly in these settings. The underlying problems have deep roots. The current regulatory frameworks and standards, which are set by high-income countries, are too stringent, and do not take into account the limited resources of poorer settings. Thus, they are often inapplicable in such settings. One of the main issues affecting the oxygen concentrators, is that related to the filters, which are designed to filter out dust, particles, bacteria, and to be used in medical locations complying with international standards (e.g., the air filtration level in a surgical theatre in Italy is at 99.97%). When used in low-resource settings, which do not comply with these standards and face several challenges (e.g., dust), these filters have a much-reduced lifespan. For these reasons, this paper aims to present the redesign of the inlet filter of an oxygen concentrator, which is used to prevent gross particles to enter the device. The redesign is based on a reverse engineering approach, and on the use of 3D-printing along with activated charcoal. After testing the filtration efficiency with a particle counter, the filter design has been refined through several iterations. The final prototype performs particularly well when filtering particles above 1 μm (with a filtration efficiency of 64.2%), and still has a satisfactory performance with any particle size over 0.3 μm (with a filtration efficiency of 38.8%). Following the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, this project aims to empower local communities, and start a positive trend of self-sustained supply chain of simple spare parts for medical devices, leveraging on frugal engineering, 3D-printing, locally produced activated charcoal, and circular economy.",2022-01-19,"Williams, Ellis; Piaggio, Davide; Andellini, Martina; Pecchia, Leandro",Dev Eng,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/07d63d009aaa69f62a57626b7c0e2dc7591ba06c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/92689daa6c04a6e7ef481f00b5418290eb38c2cd.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8768026.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352728522000033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35071724/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.deveng.2022.100094; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352728522000033?v=s5,246040217.0

METHODS: We elucidated post-vaccination antibody profiles of 69 naïve and 17 COVID-19 convalescent adults using pseudovirus neutralization assay (PsVNA) covering SARS-CoV-2 WA-1, variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs). Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) was used to measure antibody affinity against prefusion spike and receptor binding domain (RBD) and RBD mutants. FINDINGS: Higher neutralizing antibodies were observed in convalescent vs. naïve adults against, WA-1, VOCs, and VOIs. Antibody binding to RBD and RBD mutants showed lower binding of post-vaccination sera from naïve compared with convalescent individuals. Moreover, we observed early antibody affinity maturation in convalescent individuals after one vaccine dose and higher antibody affinity after two doses compared with the naïve group. Among the naïve participants, antibody affinity against the SARS-CoV-2 prefusion spike was significantly higher for males than females even though there were no difference in neutralization titers between sexes. INTERPRETATION: This study demonstrates the impact of prior infection on vaccine-induced antibody affinity maturation and difference in antibody affinity between males and females. Further studies are needed to determine whether antibody affinity may contribute to correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.

After eight weeks of intra-articular injection of the miR-186-5p and negative control lentivirus samples, the knee cartilage tissues were subjected to histopathological analysis Safranin-O/Fast green staining. Further, the articular chondrocytes were separated and analysed for various proteins including P2X7, cathepsin-K, RUNX2 and ADAMTS5 using Western blotting method. We observed that the protein expressions of P2X7, cathepsin-K/RUNX2/ADAMTS5, and also MMP-13 were upmodulated in the KOA rats, while intra-articular miR-186-5p lentivirus administration prevented these aberrations. Hence, the study concludes that miR-186 orchestrates P2X7 expression and the P2X7-mediated cathepsin-K/RUNX2/ADAMTS5 axis and regulates the pathogenesis of KOA.

To date, the comparative effectiveness and safety of the standard dose and lower doses of pembrolizumab in these patients still remains limited. We conducted a retrospective cohort study by analyzing electronic medical records data from the largest multi-institutional hospital system in Taiwan. Advanced NSCLC patients newly receiving pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy were included. Patients were classified into: (1) the standard-dose group (≥2 mg/kg), and (2) the low-dose group (<2 mg/kg). We applied inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to compare the overall survival (OS) and immune-related adverse events (irAEs) between the two treatment groups, and to evaluate the minimum clinically effective dose of pembrolizumab. We included a total of 147 NSCLC patients receiving standard-dose pembrolizumab (mean [range] age: 63.7 [58.0-73.0] years; male: 62.6%; mean [range] body weight: 60.5 [58.0-73.0] kg) and 95 patients receiving low-dose pembrolizumab (mean [range] age: 62.0 [50.0-68.8] years; male: 64.2%; mean [range] body weight: 63.9 [55.0-73.8] kg). After IPTW adjustments, the median OS was similar for both the standard-dose and low-dose pembrolizumab groups (19.3 vs. 14.3 months, log-rank p = 0.15). Also, the rate for all classes of irAEs was similar for both groups. We found that patients with a pembrolizumab dose ≥1.8 mg/kg were associated with better OS than those receiving <1.8 mg/kg.

Several studies have recently been published on the impact of COVID-19-related loneliness among older populations, but little has been written about the experiences of already-lonely older individuals; those who had lived with persistent loneliness before the advent of COVID-19. This qualitative study sought to understand how already-lonely older individuals navigated and endured the social isolation of the pandemic. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twelve semistructured interviews were conducted with individuals aged 65 or older who scored a 6 or above on the 3-item UCLA Loneliness Risk screening tool. Interviews were coded using the constant comparative method. Themes and understandings of loneliness that reoccurred within and across interviews were identified and collected. RESULTS: Already-isolated older interviewees did not necessarily experience the abject loneliness hypothesized by analysts. Most interviewees used longstanding arrangements, in place to mitigate loneliness and endure social isolation, to manage the social deprivation of COVID-19. As a result, their loneliness did not compound during long bouts of mandated social isolation. To the contrary, loneliness during the pandemic appeared to carry a new valence for interviewees, as COVID-19 imbued their isolation with new meaning, rendering their loneliness necessary and responsible.

Our aim was to collect, evaluate and represent the information relating to current clinical practice for the diagnosis of VAP in UK NHS ICUs, and to explore the potential value and role of a novel diagnostic for VAP, which uses optical molecular alveoscopy to visualise the alveolar space. METHODS: Qualitative study performing semi-structured interviews with clinical experts. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematically analysed. A flow diagram of the VAP patient pathway was elicited and validated with the expert interviewees. Fourteen clinicians were interviewed from a range of UK NHS hospitals: 12 ICU consultants, 1 professor of respiratory medicine and 1 professor of critical care. RESULTS: Five themes were identified, relating to [1] current practice for the diagnosis of VAP, [2] current clinical need in VAP diagnostics, [3] the potential value and role of the technology, [4] the barriers to adoption and [5] the evidence requirements for the technology, to help facilitate a successful adoption. These themes indicated that diagnosis of VAP is extremely difficult, as is the decision to stop antibiotic treatment. The analysis revealed that there is a clinical need for a diagnostic that provides an accurate and timely diagnosis of the causative pathogen, without the long delays associated with return of culture results, and which is not dangerous to the patient. It was determined that the technology would satisfy important aspects of this clinical need for diagnosing VAP (and pneumonia, more generally), but would require further evidence on safety and efficacy in the patient population to facilitate adoption. CONCLUSIONS: Care pathway analysis performed in this study was deemed accurate and representative of current practice for diagnosing VAP in a UK ICU as determined by relevant clinical experts, and explored the value and role of a novel diagnostic, which uses optical technology, and could streamline the diagnostic pathway for VAP and other pneumonias.

To address this need, we present a system to enable rapid and efficacious splitting between two or more patients with varying lung compliances and tidal volume requirements. Reserved for dire situations, ventilator splitting is complex, and has been limited to patients with similar pulmonary compliances and tidal volume requirements. Here, we report a 3D printed ventilator splitter and resistor system (VSRS) that uses interchangeable airflow resistors to deliver optimal tidal volumes to patients with differing respiratory physiologies, thereby expanding the applicability of ventilator splitting to a larger patient pool. We demonstrate the capability of the VSRS using benchtop test lungs and standard-of-care ventilators, which produced data used to validate a complementary, patient-specific airflow computational model. The computational model allows clinicians to rapidly select optimal resistor sizes and predict delivered pressures and tidal volumes on-demand from different patient characteristics and ventilator settings. Due to the inherent need for rapid deployment, all simulations for the wide range of clinically-relevant patient characteristics and ventilator settings were pre-computed and compiled into an easy to use mobile app. As a result, over 200 million individual computational simulations were performed to maximize the number of scenarios for which the VSRS can provide assistance.

Chloroplast genomes have been widely used for plant phylogenetic inference recently. The number of complete chloroplast genomes increases rapidly with the development of various genome sequencing projects. However, no comprehensive platform or tool has been developed for the comparative and phylogenetic analysis of chloroplast genomes. Thus, we constructed a comprehensive platform for the comparative and phylogenetic analysis of complete chloroplast genomes which was named as chloroplast genome analysis platform (CGAP). RESULTS: CGAP is an interactive web-based platform which was designed for the comparative analysis of complete chloroplast genomes. CGAP integrated genome collection, visualization, content comparison, phylogeny analysis and annotation functions together. CGAP implemented four web servers including creating complete and regional genome maps of high quality, comparing genome features, constructing phylogenetic trees using complete genome sequences, and annotating draft chloroplast genomes submitted by users.

In particular, clinicians should not lose sight of the patient experience, which we can be assessed with the help of patient-reported outcomes (PROs). CASE REPORT: An 84-year-old man infected with SARS-CoV-2 was already suffering from multiple health conditions, including Type 2 diabetes mellitus. He most likely was receiving cortisone therapy and had chronic pain with spondylosis with radiculopathy, bilateral gonarthrosis following total knee replacement, malaise, and fatigue. The patient received acute inpatient care in a hospital that provides complementary medical therapies. We collected clinical and patient-reported data on quality of life, physical functions, the sensation of pain, psychological well-being, and symptoms while taking into account the degree of chronicity of the conditions, the level of the patient’s pain, and his hospitalization in an isolation ward.

Here we describe a human monoclonal antibody designated S2X259, which recognizes a highly conserved cryptic epitope of the receptor-binding domain and cross-reacts with spikes from all clades of sarbecovirus. S2X259 broadly neutralizes spike-mediated cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, including variants of concern (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and B.1.427/B.1.429), as well as a wide spectrum of human and potentially zoonotic sarbecoviruses through inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding to the receptor-binding domain. Furthermore, deep-mutational scanning and in vitro escape selection experiments demonstrate that S2X259 possesses an escape profile that is limited to a single substitution, G504D. We show that prophylactic and therapeutic administration of S2X259 protects Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) against challenge with the prototypic SARS-CoV-2 and the B.1.351 variant of concern, which suggests that this monoclonal antibody is a promising candidate for the prevention and treatment of emergent variants and zoonotic infections.

METHODS Exosomes were isolated from human aqueous humour (AH) by ultracentrifugation, and visualized by nanoparticle tracking and transmission electron microscopy. Exosomal miRNA sequencing was performed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs between diabetes with cataracts (DMC) group and age-related cataracts (ARC) group. TargetScan was used to predict potential target of certain miRNA. The expression of CACNA1C mRNA was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and CACNA1C protein was determined by Western blotting. Concentration of Ca2+ in human AH and the culture supernatant of cells were detected by the calcium assay kit. Cell counting kit-8 was used to determine cell viability. RESULTS Exosomes were isolated from human AH, which had a typical cup-shaped phenotype and a particle size distribution in accordance with micro extracellular vesicles. Exosomal miRNA sequencing revealed that miR-29b was significantly downregulated in DMC group compared with ARC. Ca2+ concentration of human AH in DMC was higher than that in ARC. The culture supernatant of cells transfected with miR-29b inhibitors had a higher concentration of Ca2+ than that transfected with miR-29b mimics. miR-29b reduced the viability of HLECs by upregulating CACNA1C expression.

Applying saliva on fingers for enumerating bank notes is a common practice in the Indian subcontinent. Paper notes may be a potential source of “horizontal” transmission of this virus, especially if there are cuts/bruises on the oral mucous membrane or skin. AIM: To investigate whether paper currencies could be a plausible mode of horizontal transmission of HBV infection. METHODS: Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) followed by nucleotide sequencing was done for the detection of HBV. Hepatitis B virus surface antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(HBsAg ELISA) was performed on all HBV deoxyribonucleic acid-positive samples to check the detectability of the virus. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was carried out for visual confirmation of HBV particles in ultracentrifuged/immunoprecipitated samples from currency paper washings. RESULTS: HBV-specific PCRs on pellets obtained after ultracentrifugation/ immunoprecipitation of the currency paper washings detected potentially intact/viable HBV (genotype D2) in 7.14% of samples (n = 70). AFM gave the visual confirmation of HBV particles in ultracentrifuged/immunoprecipitated samples from currency paper washings. However, HBV isolates from the currency notes could not be detected by HBsAg ELISA. CONCLUSION: It is a common practice in the Indian subcontinent to count paper currencies by applying saliva on fingertips. Paper notes may be a potential source of “horizontal” transmission of this virus, especially if there are cuts/bruises on the oral mucous membrane or skin, but it was practically not possible to demonstrate experimentally such transmission.

The discovery that the SARS-CoV-2 uses the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) component ACE2 as a receptor to invade host epithelial cells and cause organs damage resulted in a debate regarding the role of ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) therapies during COVID-19 pandemic. Some authors proposed the discontinuation of ACEIs and ARBs for cardiovascular, kidney, and metabolic diseases, while expert opinions have discouraged that due to limited empirical evidence of their negative effect on COVID-19 outcomes, and that withdrawing treatment may contribute to clinical decompensation in high-risk patients.

No new COVID-19 case had been diagnosed since February 13. During the epidemic, 7 HD patients died, including 6 with COVID-19 and 1 without COVID-19. The presumed causes of death were not directly related to pneumonia, but due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, hyperkalemia, etc. Most of the leukocytes in the peripheral blood of the HD patients infected with COVID-19 decreased, and the CT images of the chest mostly showed the ground glass like changes on the right side. The symptoms of most of the patients were mild, and there were no cases admitted to ICU. The frequency of lymphocytes in PBMCs and the serum level of inflammatory cytokines were assessed in HD patients contracted COVID-19 or not, non-HD COVID-19 patients, as well as healthy volunteers. The results showed that lymphocytes of T cell, Th cells, killer T cells, as well as NK cells in PBMCs of HD patients decreased significantly than other groups. HD patients with COVID-19 also displayed remarkable lower serum level of inflammatory cytokines than other COVID-19 patients. Our study indicates that HD patients are the highly susceptible population and HD centers are high risk area in the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic. Measures of prevention, protection, screening, isolation, and distribution are essential in the epidemic management and should be taken in the early stage. HD Patients with COVID-19 are mostly clinical mild and unlikely progress to severe pneumonia due to the impaired cellular immune function and incapability of mounting cytokines storm. More attention should be paid to prevent cardiovascular events, which may be the collateral impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD patients.",2020-02-25,"Ma, Y.; Diao, B.; Lv, X.; Zhu, J.; Liang, W.; Liu, L.; Bu, W.; Cheng, H.; Zhang, S.; Shi, M.; Ding, G.; Shen, B.; Wang, H.",,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/8dbfb1122839fd2802805136525b502f9dc74d28.json,,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.24.20027201v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027201,215718959.0

Tissue lesions can be caused by the pathogen or can be driven by an overwhelmed immune response. Focusing on SARS-CoV-2, we and others have observed that this virus can trigger indeed an immune response that can be dysregulated in severe patients and leading to further injury to multiple organs. The purpose of the review is to bring to light the current knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 virologic and immunologic features. Thus, we address virus biology, life cycle, tropism for many organs and how ultimately it will affect several host biological and physiological functions, notably the immune response.

Therefore, we evaluated the SARS-CoV-2-IgG response in 51 SASR-CoV-2-PCR-confirmed outpatients with five commercial immunoassays. The sensitivity in serum samples, collected at a median of 24 days after onset of symptoms, detected by the Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA IgG (Euroimmun), EDI™ Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 IgG ELISA (Epitope Diagnostics), Liaison(®) SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG (Diasorin), SARS-CoV-2 IgG on the Architect™ i2000 (Abbott), and Elecsys(®) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (IgM/IgA/IgG) on the cobas™ e801 (Roche) was 84.3%, 78.4%, 74.5%, 86.3%, and 88.2%, respectively. The sensitivity in serum samples, collected >20 days after onset of symptoms, varied between 75.0% and 90.0%, and in samples, collected at least 28 days after onset of symptoms, did not increase, except in the Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA IgG by Euroimmun (90.0%).

The mechanism and regulation of nsp13 has not been explored at the single-molecule level. Specifically, force-dependent unwinding experiments have yet to be performed for any coronavirus helicase. Here, using optical tweezers, we find that nsp13 unwinding frequency, processivity, and velocity increase substantially when a destabilizing force is applied to the dsRNA, suggesting a passive unwinding mechanism. These results, along with bulk assays, depict nsp13 as an intrinsically weak helicase that can be potently activated by picoNewton forces. Such force-dependent behavior contrasts the known behavior of other viral monomeric helicases, drawing stronger parallels to ring-shaped helicases.

The side effects of this treatment are not known; therefore, this study was performed to determine the final outcome and complications of hemoperfusion in patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in ICU. METHODS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, all patients with severe COVID-19 without any comorbidities or organ failure who underwent hemoperfusion treatment in ICU at Kosar Hospital in Semnan, Iran, during March - November 2021 were included. The clinical data and short-term complications up to 10 days after hemoperfusion and the final outcome were extracted from medical files. RESULTS: The mean age of 40 patients with severe COVID-19 undergoing hemoperfusion was 57.5±15.9 years. Most (24, 60%) patients were male. The time interval from hospitalization to hemoperfusion and the time interval between hemoperfusion and final outcome was 4.85 days and 8.30 days, respectively. Arrhythmia, bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and coagulation disorders were the most common short-term complications of hemoperfusion in patients with COVID-19, respectively. Most complications occurred on the second and third days after hemoperfusion. Mortality occurred in 20 (50 %) patients with severe COVID-19 undergoing hemoperfusion in ICU. CONCLUSION: It seems that the short-term complications and deaths due to hemoperfusion are relatively high in patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU.

The buccal delivery of ondansetron hydrochloride was remarkably boosted by employing physical (iontophoresis) and chemical enhancement approaches (chemical penetration enhancers). To explore the influence of different formulation components, i.e., agarose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), and glycerol on various evaluating parameters, i.e., tensile strength, swelling index, ex vivo mucoadhesion time, and subsequently on in vitro drug release, a D-optimal design was opted. A buccal film bearing OND was mounted on bovine buccal mucosa for ex vivo permeation studies and impact of chemical and physical enhancement techniques on the permeation profile was also analysed. A linear release profile was revealed in in vitro drug release of OND over 60 minutes and outcomes ascertained the direct relationship between HPMC content and in vitro drug release and inverse relationship was depicted by AG content. The FTIR and DSC thermal analysis was executed to determine the physicochemical interactions and results exposed no chemical interactions between drug and polymers. The drug (OND) appeared as tiny crystals on smooth film surface during scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. A notable enhancement in permeation flux, i.e., 761.02 µg/min of OND during ex vivo permeation studies was witnessed after the application of current (0.5-1 mA) without any time lag and with enhancement ratio of 3.107. A time lag of 15 minutes, 19 minutes, and 26 minutes with permeation flux of 475.34 µg/min, 399.35 µg/min, and 244.81 µg/min was observed after chemical enhancer pretreatment with propylene glycol, Tween 80, and passive, respectively. Rabbit was employed as the experimental animal for pharmacokinetic studies (in vivo) and cats for pharmacological activity (in vivo), and the results illustrated the enhanced bioavailablity (2.88 times) in the iontophoresis animal group when compared with the rabbits of control group.

We evaluated and compared 4 different commercial serology tests, three of them had the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Our goal was to provide new data to help to guide the interpretation and the choice of the serological tests. Methods: Four commercial tests were evaluated: Cobas(R)Roche(R)(total anti-N antibodies), VIDAS(R)Biomerieux(R)(IgM and IgG anti-RBD antibodies), Mindray(R)(IgM and IgG anti-N and anti-RBD antibodies) and Access(R)Beckman Coulter(R)(IgG anti-RBD antibodies). Were tested: a positive panel (n=72 sera) obtained from COVID-19 confirmed patients and a negative panel (n=119) of pre-pandemic sera. Were determined the analytical performances and was drawn the ROC curve to assess the manufacturer's threshold. Results: A large range of variability between the tests was found. Mindray(R)IgG and Cobas(R) tests showed the best overall sensitivity 79,2%CI95%[67,9-87,8]. Cobas(R) showed the best sensitivity after D14; 85,4%CI95%[72,2-93,9]. The best specificity was noted for Cobas(R), VIDAS(R)IgG and Access(R) IgG(100%CI95%[96,9-100]). Access(R) had the lower sensitivity even after D14 (55,5% CI95%[43,4-67,3]). VIDAS(R)IgM and Mindray(R)IgM tests showed the lowest specificity and sensitivity rates. Overall, only 43 out of 72 sera gave concordant results (59,7%). Retained cut-offs for a significantly better sensitivity and accuracy, without altering significantly the specificity, were: 0,87 for Vidas(R)IgM(p=0,01), 0,55 for Vidas(R)IgG(p=0,05) and 0,14 for Access(R)(p<10-4). Conclusion: Although FDA approved, each laboratory should realize its own evaluation for commercial tests.

We found that a mutation at amino acid position 90 in the H5N1 HA, outside the receptor-binding domain (RBD), could simultaneously induce changes in the RBD conformation to escape from nAb binding and alter the receptor preference through long-range regulation. This mutation was deemed a “key event” for interspecies transmission. It is likely a result of positive selection caused by antibodies, allowing the original invasion by new species-specific variants. A mutation at amino acid position 160 in the RBD only induced a change in receptor preference. This mutation was deemed a “maintaining adaptation”, which ensured that influenza virus variants would be able to infect new organisms of a different species successfully. The mutation is the result of adaptation caused by the receptor. Our results suggest that continuing occurrence of these two types of mutations made the variants persist in the new host species.

Apart from having acute severe respiratory illness causing high mortality, the disease also has a variety of cardiovascular manifestations contributing to morbidity as well as mortality. Cardiac dysfunction and myocarditis are well established complications of Covid-19 as evident in multiple studies after the Covid-19 pandemic. However it is not sufficiently studied in Indian patients either by Echocardiography or by any other imaging modalities like cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODOLOGY: In this study, we analysed the severity of Left ventricular(LV) dysfunction in Covid-19 survivors. A total of 100 consecutive patients of Covid-19 after one month of discharge who had no underlying cardiovascular diseases underwent echocardiography and global longitudinal strain (GLS) imaging. This study cohort included patients with mild 42 (42%),moderate 46(46%) and severe 12(12%) Covid-19 disease as defined by computerised tomography (CT) severity score. RESULT: We observed that total 36(36%) patients had reduced ejection fraction(EF) which included 11 patients having EF <40% and remaining 25(25%) having EF 40–50% (p<0.002). Also 22 (22%) patients had abnormal global longitudinal strain (GLS) values with normal ejection fraction which is suggestive of subclinical myocarditis. We observed LV dysfunction in 7(19.5%) patients who had severe Covid-19 while mild to moderate LV dysfunction observed in 29(80.5%) non critical patients. CONCLUSION: In conclusion our study demonstrates that myocardial dysfunction is common in covid-19 regardless of disease severity. 2D-echocardiography with GLS is likely to detect early LV dysfunction among these patients.",2021-12-18,"Kujur, Punya Pratap; Jhala, Malav; Bhondve, Amit; Lanjewar, Charan; Matta, Rajesh; Deshmukh, Hemant",Indian Heart J,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/583deb601d430e863e1f4b1bd2f816ed38866615.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1687da6fd22e48b09b1a7e122755f2f96c3f54da.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8683382.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019483221004582; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34933014/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019483221004582?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ihj.2021.12.007,245264350.0

Many of the apps lack disclaimers about the collection of user information, and there is no governing body to oversee and regulate app development and availability. This is particularly problematic with mental health–related smartphone apps, because many developers are not affiliated with mental health professionals, and many apps do not provide emergency information should a mental health emergency occur while using the app. Moreover, users are left to haphazardly make decisions about health-related apps usage without assistance.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of a nationwide lockdown in France on admissions to hospital for acute myocardial infarction, by patient characteristics and regional prevalence of the pandemic. METHODS: In this registry study, we collected data from 21 centres participating in the ongoing French Cohort of Myocardial Infarction Evaluation (FRENCHIE) registry, which collects data from all patients admitted for ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) within 48 h of symptom onset. We analysed weekly hospital admissions over 8 weeks: the 4 weeks preceding the institution of the lockdown and the 4 weeks following lockdown. The primary outcome was the change in the number of hospital admissions for all types of acute myocardial infarction, NSTEMI, and STEMI between the 4 weeks before lockdown and the 4 weeks after lockdown. Comparisons between categorical variables were made using χ(2) tests or Fisher's exact tests. Comparisons of continuous variables were made using Student's t tests or Mann-Whitney tests. Poisson regression was used to determine the significance of change in hospital admissions over the two periods, after verifying the absence of overdispersion. Age category, region, and type of acute myocardial infarction (STEMI or NSTEMI) were used as covariables. The FRENCHIE cohort is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04050956. FINDINGS: Between Feb 17 and April 12, 2020, 1167 patients were consecutively admitted within 48 h of acute myocardial infarction (583 with STEMI, 584 with NSTEMI) and were included in the study. Admissions for acute myocardial infarction decreased between the periods before and after lockdown was instituted, from 686 before to 481 after lockdown (30% decrease; incidence rate ratio 0·69 [95% CI 0·51–0·70]). Admissions for STEMI decreased from 331 to 252 (24%; 0·72 [0·62–0·85]), and admissions for NSTEMI decreased from 355 to 229 (35%; 0·64 [0·55–0·76]) following institution of the lockdown, with similar trends according to sex, risk factors, and regional prevalence of hospital admissions for COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: A marked decrease in hospital admissions was observed following the lockdown, irrespective of patient characteristics and regional prevalence of COVID-19. Health authorities should be aware of these findings, in order to adapt their message if the COVID-19 pandemic persists or recurs, or in case of future major epidemics.

METHODS: A stepped wedge cluster randomized study design enrolling 47 first-level leaders from child- and adult-specialized mental health clinics within Norwegian health trusts across three cohorts. All therapists (n = 790) received training in screening of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress, and a subgroup of therapists (n = 248) received training in evidence-based treatment methods for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). First-level leaders and therapists completed surveys at baseline, 4, 8-, 12-, 16-, and 20-months assessing leadership and implementation climate. General linear mixed-effects models were used to investigate whether the LOCI strategy would lead to greater therapist-rated scores on implementation leadership, transformational leadership, and implementation climate. RESULTS: After introducing the LOCI strategy, there was a significant increase in therapist-rated implementation and transformational leadership and implementation climate. The increase was sustained at all measurement time points compared to non-LOCI conditions, which demonstrated a steady decrease in scores before LOCI. CONCLUSIONS: The LOCI strategy can develop better transformational and implementation leadership skills and contribute to a more positive implementation climate, which may enhance successful EBP implementation. Thus, LOCI can help leaders create an organizational context conducive for effective EBP implementation.

Here, we review the recent literature on future air quality scenarios and projected changes in effects on human health, crops and ecosystems. While there is overlap in the scenarios and models used for future projections of air quality and climate effects on human health and crops, similar efforts have not been widely conducted for ecosystems. Few studies have conducted joint assessments across more than one sector. Improvements in future air quality effects on human health are seen in emission reduction scenarios that are more ambitious than current legislation. Larger impacts result from changing particulate matter (PM) abundances than ozone burdens. Future global health burdens are dominated by changes in the Asian region. Expected future reductions in ozone outside of Asia will allow for increased crop production. Reductions in PM, although associated with much higher uncertainty, could offset some of this benefit. The responses of ecosystems to air pollution and climate change are long-term, complex, and interactive, and vary widely across biomes and over space and time.

We used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to investigate the interrelationship between COVID-19 vaccination intention and perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived self-efficacy, and perceived response efficacy. RESULTS: SEM showed that perceived severity to COVID-19 (β = .17, p < .001), perceived self-efficacy about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (β = .26, p < .001), and the perceived response efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine (β = .70, p < .001) were significant predictors of vaccination intention. PMT accounted for 61.5% of the variance in intention to COVID-19 vaccination, and perceived response efficacy was the strongest predictor of COVID-19 vaccination intention. CONCLUSIONS: This study found the PMT constructs are useful in predicting COVID-19 vaccination intention. Programs designed to increase the vaccination rate after discovering the COVID-19 vaccine can include interventions on the severity of the COVID-19, the self-efficacy of individuals receiving the vaccine, and the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing infection.",2021-06-17,"Ansari-Moghaddam, Alireza; Seraji, Maryam; Sharafi, Zahra; Mohammadi, Mahdi; Okati-Aliabad, Hassan",BMC Public Health,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/041360c7ab08411252fa3545f100924f97a479ce.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8209774.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140015/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11134-8,235454161.0

The classic presentation of GBS is characterized by ascending limb weakness and numbness with loss of reflexes. However, atypical variants involving the face and arms or with purely sensory symptoms also exist. In up to 30 percent of cases, GBS progresses to respiratory failure, with patients requiring mechanical ventilation. CASE REPORT: We report a case of atypical GBS occurring after COVID-19 vaccination in an otherwise healthy 38-year-old male. The patient's clinical presentation was characterized by bilateral hand and foot paresthesias, dysarthria, bilateral facial weakness, and an absence of classic ascending limb weakness. Albuminocytological dissociation within the cerebrospinal fluid was suggestive of GBS. The patient received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy with modest improvement in his symptoms at the time of the patient's discharge from the hospital. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Patients with GBS are at risk for life threatening complications including respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. It is critical for Emergency physicians to be aware of the manifold presentations of GBS for early recognition and treatment.

DESIGN: We used an exploratory qualitative study design. SETTING: Mombasa and Kilifi Counties of Coastal Kenya. PARTICIPANTS: 25 key informants including community leaders, professionals and community members directly and indirectly affected by suicidality. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with purposively selected key informants to collect data on sociocultural perspectives of suicide. Thematic analysis was used to identify key themes using both inductive and deductive processes. RESULTS: Four key themes were identified from the inductive content analysis of 25 in-depth interviews as being important for understanding cultural perspectives related to suicidality: (1) the stigma of suicidal behaviour, with suicidal victims perceived as weak or crazy, and suicidal act as evil and illegal; (2) the attribution of supernatural causality to suicide, for example, due to sorcery or inherited curses; (3) the convoluted pathway to care, specifically, delayed access to biomedical care and preference for informal healers; and (4) gender and age differences influencing suicide motivation, method of suicide and care seeking behaviour for suicidality. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an in depth understanding of cultural factors attributed to suicide in this rural community that may engender stigma, discrimination and poor access to mental healthcare in this community.

Participants: Individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a large academic healthcare system (N=72,909) from March 8-June 9 2020 stratified by HCW and patient-facing status. Main Measures: SARS-CoV-2 test result, hospitalization, and ICU admission for COVID-19 infection. Key Results: Of 72,909 individuals tested, 9.0% (551) of 6,145 HCW tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared to 6.5% (4353) of 66,764 non-HCW. The HCW were younger than non-HCW (median age 39.7 vs. 57.5, p<0.001) with more females (proportion of males 21.5 vs. 44.9%, p<0.001), higher reporting of COVID-19 exposure (72 vs. 17 %, p<0.001) and fewer comorbidities.

Increasingly, the immune system has been recognized as an important contributor to vascular disease, but few studies have examined immune factors relative to AVF maturation outcomes. This study evaluated the association of serum panel reactive antibodies (PRA), a measure of immune system reactivity assessed in patients undergoing kidney transplant evaluation, with AVF nonmaturation. Methods: We identified 132 patients at our institution who underwent surgical AVF placement between 2010-2019 and had PRA testing within 1 year of AVF creation. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the association of patient demographic and clinical factors, class I and class II PRA levels, and preoperative arterial and venous diameters with AVF maturation outcomes. Results: AVF nonmaturation was more likely in females than males (44% versus 20%, P=0.003) and in Black than white patients (40% versus 13%, P=0.001). Class II PRA was higher in females than males (12%±23% versus 4%±13%, P=0.02). In the multivariable model, AVF nonmaturation was associated with class II PRA (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.34 per 10% increase; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.04 to 1.82, P=0.02) and Black race (aOR, 3.34; 95% CI, 1.02 to 10.89, P=0.03), but not with patient sex or preoperative arterial or venous diameters.

The immune response to this disease is thought to lead to a cytokine storm, which contributes to the severity of illness. There is an urgent need to confirm whether the use of tocilizumab provides a benefit in individuals with COVID-19. Methods A single-center propensity-score matched cohort study, including all consecutive COVID-19 patients, admitted to the medical center who were either discharged from the medical center or expired between March 1, 2020, and May 5, 2020, was performed. Patients were stratified according to the receipt of tocilizumab for cytokine storm and matched to controls using propensity scores. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Results A total of 132 patients were included in the matched dataset (tocilizumab=66; standard of care=66). Approximately 73% of the patients were male. Hypertension (55%), diabetes mellitus (31%), and chronic pulmonary disease (15%) were the most common comorbidities present. There were 18 deaths (27.3%) in the tocilizumab group and 18 deaths (27.3%) in the standard of care group (odds ratio, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.465 - 2.151; p=1.00). Advanced age, history of myocardial infarction, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, heart failure, and malignancy were significantly more common in patients who died. Interpretation The current analysis does not support the use of tocilizumab for the management of cytokine storm in patients with COVID-19.

Many challenges in delivering multidisciplinary team (MDT) care exist, such as insufficient expertise among different healthcare professionals, poor interdisciplinary collaboration, and communication. The need to attend different clinics, incurring additional traveling and waiting time for allied health therapies can also make MDT care more burdensome. By shifting MDT care to local community settings and into patients' homes, patient-centered care can be achieved. In Singapore, the National Neuroscience Institute created the Community Care Partners Programme in 2007 to bring the allied MDT team to the community and nurse-led Integrated Community Care Programme for Parkinson's Disease in 2012 to provide care in community and at patient's home. However, attaining MDT care in the community setting is difficult to achieve where there is a shortage of PD-trained professionals.

A prospective observational outpatient study",10.1371/journal.pone.0241760,PMC7641406,33147269.0,cc-by,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Treatment guidelines do not recommend antibiotic use for acute respiratory infections (ARI), except for streptococcal pharyngitis/tonsillitis and pneumonia. However, antibiotics are prescribed frequently for children with ARI, often in absence of evidence for bacterial infection. The objectives of this study were 1) to assess the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for mild ARI in paediatric outpatients in relation to available guidelines and detected pathogens, 2) to assess antibiotic use on presentation using questionnaires and detection in urine 3) to assess the carriage rates and proportions of resistant intestinal Enterobacteriaceae before, during and after consultation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were prospectively enrolled in Children’s Hospital 1, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and diagnoses, prescribed therapy and outcome were recorded on first visit and on follow-up after 7 days. Respiratory bacterial and viral pathogens were detected using molecular assays. Antibiotic use before presentation was assessed using questionnaires and urine HPLC. The impact of antibiotic usage on intestinal Enterobacteriaceae was assessed with semi-quantitative culture on agar with and without antibiotics on presentation and after 7 and 28 days. RESULTS: A total of 563 patients were enrolled between February 2009 and February 2010. Antibiotics were prescribed for all except 2 of 563 patients. The majority were 2(nd) and 3(rd) generation oral cephalosporins and amoxicillin with or without clavulanic acid. Respiratory viruses were detected in respiratory specimens of 72.5% of patients. Antibiotic use was considered inappropriate in 90.1% and 67.5%, based on guidelines and detected pathogens, respectively. On presentation parents reported antibiotic use for 22% of patients, 41% of parents did not know and 37% denied antibiotic use. Among these three groups, six commonly used antibiotics were detected with HPLC in patients’ urine in 49%, 40% and 14%, respectively. Temporary selection of 3(rd) generation cephalosporin resistant intestinal Enterobacteriaceae during antibiotic use was observed, with co-selection of resistance to aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. CONCLUSIONS: We report overuse and overprescription of antibiotics for uncomplicated ARI with selection of resistant intestinal Enterobacteriaceae, posing a risk for community transmission and persistence in a setting of a highly granular healthcare system and unrestricted access to antibiotics through private pharmacies.

We analyse three urban renewal projects: the Lavasa eco-city, the Rajarhat green-city, and the Dholera smart city, arguing why a case-study based approach is significant to study the connection between policy promises and actual socio-environmental realities. Our empirical explorations reveal that processes and practices involved in the making of these projects are ‘utopian’; in reality, they tend to uproot the existing urban ecological buffers, critically impacting the quality of urban life across classes.

Due to the physical and chemical nature of sulphuric acid hydrolyzed nanocellulose and the antiviral properties of curcumin, the possibility of using these nanoparticles as an inhalable nanotherapeutic for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed. The adsorption of curcumin and PVA into nanocellulose, and the presence of anionic sulphate groups, which is important for the interaction with viral glycoproteins were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. FESEM images showed that the diameter of nanocellulose ranged from 50 to 100 nm, which is closer to the diameter (60–140 nm) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The solubility of poorly water-soluble curcumin was increased from 40.58 ± 1.42 to 313.61 ± 1.05 mg/L with increasing the PVA concentration from 0.05 to 0.8% (w/v) in aqueous medium. This is a significant increase in the solubility compared to curcumin’s solubility in carboxymethyl cellulose medium in our previous study. The drug loading capacity increased by 22-fold with the addition of 0.8% PVA to the nanocellulose dispersed curcumin solution. The highest drug release increased from 1.25 ± 0.15 mg/L to 17.11 ± 0.22 mg/L with increasing the PVA concentration from 0 to 0.8% in the drug-loaded medium. Future studies of this material will be based on the antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 and cell cytotoxicity studies. Due to the particulate nature, morphology and size of SARS-CoV-2, nanoparticle-based strategies offer a strong approach to tackling this virus. Hence, we believe that the enhanced loading of curcumin in nanocellulose will provide a promising nano-based solution for the treatment of COVID-19.

Check by Using Your Photovoltaic System as an Air-Quality Monitoring Device,10.3390/s21196342,PMC8512004,34640662.0,cc-by,"Over the past few decades, the concentrating photovoltaic systems, a source of clean and renewable energy, often fully integrated into the roof structure, have been commonly installed on private houses and public buildings. The purpose of those panels is to transform the incoming solar radiation into electricity thanks to the photovoltaic effect. The produced electric power is affected, in the first instance, by the solar panel efficiency and its technical characteristics, but it is also strictly dependent on site elevation, the meteorological conditions and on the presence of the atmospheric constituents, i.e., clouds, hydrometeors, gas molecules and sub-micron-sized particles suspended in the atmosphere that can scatter and absorb the incoming shortwave solar radiation. The Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is an adimensional wavelength-dependent atmospheric column variable that accounts for aerosol concentration. AOD can be used as a proxy to evaluate the concentration of surface particulate matter and atmospheric column turbidity, which in turn affects the solar panel energy production. In this manuscript, a new technique is developed to retrieve the AOD at 550 nm through an iterative process: the atmospheric optical depth, incremented in steps of 0.01, is used as input together with the direct and diffuse radiation fluxes computed by Fu–Liou–Gu Radiative Transfer Model, to forecast the produced electric energy by a photovoltaic panel through a simple model. The process will stop at that AOD value (at 550 nm), for which the forecast electric power will match the real produced electric power by the photovoltaic panel within a previously defined threshold. This proof of concept is the first step of a wider project that aims to develop a user-friendly smartphone application where photovoltaic panel owners, once downloaded it on a voluntary basis, can turn their photovoltaic system into a sunphotometer to continuously retrieve the AOD, and more importantly, to monitor the air quality and detect strong air pollution episodes that pose a threat for population health.",2021-09-23,"Lolli, Simone",Sensors (Basel),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/cdb27e7a20b555de931c876b7d325905a76f7a5f.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8512004.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3390/s21196342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34640662/,238639727.0

The search for an effective and efficient therapeutic and pharmaceutical intervention is as important and urgent now as it was on Day 1. Majority of the efforts in this direction are toward finding small molecule interventions via repurposing or redirecting the therapeutic approaches. This hypothesis proposes a physical intervention approach directed toward rescuing the complex lung pathology observed in COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (CARDS). The loss of content as well as the synthesis and turnover of the surfactant in ARDS has been termed as a “collateral damage.” A synergistic, early stage, cost-effective, pharmaceutically viable, safe, and immediately available solution is hence required. The effectiveness of exogenous surfactant treatment in ARDS has been marred with several limitations as pointed out in various clinical trials and require revised protocols related to surfactant dose and mode of delivery. This hypothesis proposes aerosolized surfactant delivery taking the optimal dosing and coating costs into account along with co-delivery of ambroxol to provide synergistic benefits. Ambroxol is reported to have anti-inflammatory, -oxidant, -viral, and -bacterial activities and has a direct impact on the production and secretion of the surfactant from the alveolar Type 2 cells. If aerosolized, atomized, or nebulized in the form of ambroxol-loaded phospholipid nanovesicles at the early stages of ARDS, depleted surfactant levels may be reinstated and surfactant turnover can be initiated and maintained. The ability to deliver both the components in aerosolized-nebulized form may have a huge impact on alleviating the healthcare burden in low resource settings where the availability of ventilators is limited. In conclusion, the surfactant-ambroxol co-aerosolized intervention approach hypothesized here has implications reaching to clinical and pharmaceutical translation worldwide.",2020-09-25,"Kumar, Pradeep",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/17efa178490221039e0ea0d1e15901386d6438e1.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7546362.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2020.577172; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33102461/,221910912.0

Objective To describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric asthma services and on disease burden in their patients. Methods An online survey was sent to members of the Pediatric Asthma in Real Life (PeARL) think-tank and the World Allergy Organization Pediatric Asthma Committee. It included questions on service provision, disease burden and on the clinical course of confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection among children with asthma. Results Ninety-one respondents, caring for an estimated population of >133,000 children with asthma, completed the survey. COVID-19 significantly impacted pediatric asthma services: 39% ceased physical appointments, 47% stopped accepting new patients, 75% limited patients visits. Consultations were almost halved to a median of 20 (IQR: 10-25) patients per week. Virtual clinics and helplines were launched in most centers. Better than expected disease control was reported in 20% (10-40%) of patients, while control was negatively affected in only 10% (7.5-12.5%). Adherence also appeared to increase. Only 15 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported among the population; the estimated incidence is not apparently different from the reports of general pediatric cohorts.

Canadian multiculturalism has gained much popularity in political and public discourses in the past 50 years, and it has also received no less criticism as to its effectiveness in addressing issues of racism. There have also been ambiguities over the meaning and intention of multiculturalism, leading to divergent understandings of multiculturalism as an ideal of inclusion and equity, on the one hand, and a mere political rhetoric, on the other. On the occasion of celebrating the 50(th) anniversary of Canada’s official multiculturalism policy, this article re-visits Canada’s multiculturalism by reviewing its history and ethos and critically examining its actual effects as manifested during the Covid-19 pandemic in Canada. The rise of anti-Asian racism, anti-Black racism, and anti-Indigenous racism incidents in the pandemic reveals that multiculturalism has in effect, sustained a racist and unequal society of Canada with racism entrenched in its history and ingrained in every aspect of its social structure. Multiculturalism tolerates cultural difference but does not challenge an unjust society premised on white supremacy. The anti-racism movement mobilized by racialized communities in Canada indicates that multiculturalism has failed to respond to racialized communities’ pressing demand for social change and action for social justice. The article concludes with a proposed alternative framework to multiculturalism, that is, pandemic anti-racism education model, to centre the issue of race and racism in an action-oriented, inclusive, and empowering approach toward a future of a just society.",2022-01-28,"Lei, Ling; Guo, Shibao",Int J Anthropol Ethnol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/4b5c45cea6ba3fb97501e54c661bcd77c4d68a02.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8795931.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41257-021-00060-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35106365/,246363812.0

However, the relationships between these SDOH and COVID-19 spatial outbreaks have yet to be determined. We conducted spatial analyses with geographic information systems (GIS) mapping of county-level SDOH and regional COVID-19 infection outbreaks to demonstrate the most impactful SDOH and to provide a pragmatic visual guide to prevent future outbreaks. Methods: We analyzed the geospatial associations of COVID-19 infections and SDOH to identify areas of overlap. Our sample comprised all patients in a North Carolina health care system’s registry who tested positive for COVID-19 from March 2020-February 2021. Patients’ addresses were geo-referenced and analyzed by Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to identify population-dense outbreaks of COVID-19 (hotspots). A set of 12 SDOH variables for each county were collected from the American Community Survey (ACS-5) and the Economic Research Service. Principal Component Analysis was applied to SDOH variables in order to reduce dimensions down to 3 geographical SDOH categories: Protective SDOH, High-Risk SDOH and Increased Vulnerability for Infection (Table 1). Using Multivariate Clustering Analysis (MCA), three clusters of census tracts were categorized according to SDOH indicators: decreased social disparities (DSD), equivocal social disparities (ESD) and increased social disparities (ISD) (Image A). Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's Post-Hoc adjusted with Bonferroni were utilized to verify any difference in the proportion of patients residing in the different clusters (significance p<0.05). Results: A total of 13,733 patients were included in the study. The patients predominantly reside in Durham County (55.4%), are women (56.96%), and between 40 and 69 years old (41.9%). Further, patients are predominantly white (38.7%), non-Hispanic (79.63%), and single (49.6%). The concomitant analysis of KDE and MCA showed an overlap of COVID-19 hotspots with areas of ISD (Image B). The MCA revealed that there are 308 census tracts constituted by six counties, in which 40 form ISD clusters (vs. 109 ESD;vs. 159 DSD). In addition, ISD clusters have the highest rates of infection, with 179.8 patients per 10,000 (vs. 81.7 ESD;vs. 60.1 DSD). The ISD cluster was the most densely populated and was significantly more densely populated from the ESD and DSD clusters (p=0.01). Conclusion: In this sampling of COVID-19 patients, a disproportionate amount of patients come from areas with increased social disparities, suggesting further research and health policy will need to be directed towards addressing negative and vulnerability SDOH to curtail pandemic-related outbreaks.

El tratamiento en esta subpoblación es complejo por la potencial hepatotoxicidad de algunos fármacos empleados. Más allá, la pandemia también ha impactado negativamente sobre aquellos con enfermedades hepáticas que no han adquirido la enfermedad, ya que la redistribución de los recursos humanos y materiales hacia la atención de pacientes con COVID-19, ha provocado una merma en su tratamiento, diagnóstico y seguimiento que a buen seguro tendrá consecuencias negativas en el futuro. La reorganización eficiente de las unidades de Hepatología es una necesidad de primer orden para aminorar el impacto de la pandemia sobre una población tan vulnerable como los pacientes con hepatopatía. Abstract The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has proven to be a serious challenge for the Spanish healthcare system. The impact of the virus on the liver is not well known, but in patients with chronic liver disease, mostly in advanced stages, it can critically compromise survival and trigger decompensation. Treatment in this subpopulation is complex due to the potential hepatotoxicity of some of the medicinal products used. Moreover, the pandemic has also negatively impacted patients with liver disease who have not contracted COVID-19, since the reallocation of human and material resources to the care of patients with the virus has resulted in a decrease in the treatment, diagnosis and follow-up of patients with liver disease, which will surely have negative consequences in the near future. Efficient reorganisation of hepatology units is a priority to minimise the impact of the pandemic on a population as vulnerable as liver disease patients.",2020-07-03,"Téllez, Luis; Mateos, Rosa María Martín",Gastroenterol Hepatol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/b5154bc470e5dbd0d769406d5a294f451e5e714f.json,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gastrohep.2020.06.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32727662/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0210570520302417?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0210570520302417,220303186.0

BACKGROUND: The risks from potential exposure to COVID-19, and resource reallocation that has occurred to combat the pandemic, have altered the balance of benefits and harms that informed current (pre-COVID-19) guideline recommendations for lung cancer screening and lung nodule evaluation. We developed consensus statements to guide clinicians managing lung cancer screening programs and patients with lung nodules during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An expert panel of 24 members, including pulmonologists (17), thoracic radiologists (5), and thoracic surgeons (2) was formed. The panel was provided with an overview of current evidence, summarized by recent guidelines related to lung cancer screening and lung nodule evaluation. The panel was convened by video teleconference to discuss then vote on statements related to 12 common clinical scenarios. A pre-defined threshold of 70% of panel members voting agree or strongly agree was used to determine if there was a consensus for each statement. Items that may influence decisions were listed as notes to be considered for each scenario. RESULTS: Twelve statements related to baseline and annual lung cancer screening (2), surveillance of a previously detected lung nodule (5), evaluation of intermediate and high risk lung nodules (4), and management of clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer (1) were developed and modified. All 12 statements were confirmed as consensus statements by voting results. The consensus statements provide guidance about situations where it was felt to be appropriate to delay screening, defer surveillance imaging of lung nodules, and minimize non-urgent interventions during the evaluation of lung nodules and stage I non-small cell lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS: There was consensus that during the COVID-19 pandemic it is appropriate to defer enrollment in lung cancer screening and modify the evaluation of lung nodules due to the added risks from potential exposure and the need for resource reallocation. There are multiple local, regional, and patient related factors that should be considered when applying these statements to individual patient care.",2020-04-23,"Mazzone, Peter J.; Gould, Michael K.; Arenberg, Douglas A.; Chen, Alexander C.; Choi, Humberto K.; Detterbeck, Frank C.; Farjah, Farhood; Fong, Kwun M.; Iaccarino, Jonathan M.; Janes, Samuel M.; Kanne, Jeffrey P.; Kazerooni, Ella A.; MacMahon, Heber; Naidich, David P.; Powell, Charles A.; Raoof, Suhail; Rivera, M.

This study aimed to compare the sleep quality of medical personnel conscripted to the Wuhan Union Cancer Centre to offer support during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic to the sleep quality of those who remained at Anhui Medical University Hospital and to determine the role of interventions in improving sleep quality. MATERIAL/METHODS: Questionnaires were completed by 369 individuals who were conscripted to support Wuhan (N=137) and others who were not (the control group; N=232). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to measure the duration and quality of sleep. The Anhui Provincial Health Commission organized a comprehensive intervention, consisting of physical-psychological-social dimensions, over the course of 2 weeks. RESULTS: Only 34.21% of the Wuhan support workers reported better sleep quality, as opposed to the 55.60% of the control group at stage 1 (t/χ(2)=14.005, P<.001). Furthermore, despite the Wuhan support group being more prone to poor sleep quality, their sleep quality significantly improved after the interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study showed that medical staff who were conscripted to offer support during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic suffered from impaired quality of sleep. The use of questionnaire-based sleep assessments may provide individualized approaches to supporting medical personnel during future epidemics and pandemics. Furthermore, our results indicate that relevant interventions can significantly improve sleep quality, while a prolonged break after interventions does not affect sleep quality.",2021-06-12,"Zhu, Wen; Fang, Yue; Bai, Zhong-liang; Li, Nian-nian; Zhao, Jia-yun; Hu, Zhi",Med Sci Monit,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/8c293de237109260590a63145b821e4537ddd6b9.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8207954.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.931881; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117207/,235386399.0

The objective of this study was to determine the optimal rate of inclusion level of the full-fat black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) in broiler diets and to evaluate their impact on performance, nutrient digestibility, and the immune system (blood cells and intraepithelial lymphocytes). A total of 400 male day-old Ross 308 broilers were randomly assigned to 5 treatment groups with 8 replicates each. Five inclusion levels of full-fat BSFL were investigated across starter (0, 2.5%, 5%, 7.5% and 10%), grower and finisher diets (0, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%). All diets were formulated based on digestible amino acid values according to the Aviagen (2016) recommendations. A polynomial regression at different degrees was performed to analyse broiler performance parameters (body weight, body weight gain, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio), nutrient digestibility, and blood cell count. Intraepithelial lymphocyte population data was analysed performing univariate linear regression. During the entire experimental period (from 2 to 42 d), BSFL inclusion levels decreased the feed conversion ratio by 10% in broilers that received 20% BSFL in their diets (P < 0.05). Lymphocytes and white blood cell count decreased linearly by 47.7% and 35.9%, respectively, with up to 20% BSFL inclusion (P < 0.001). A 4-fold decrease in CD3+ T lymphocytes and a 9.7-fold decrease of CD3+CD8+ intestinal cytotoxic T lymphocytes occurred in broilers fed 20% BSFL compared to the control group. These findings suggest that the inclusion of BSFL can improve broiler performance and potentially reduce immune response energy expenditure in birds fed 20% BSFL for 42 d.",2021-06-11,"de Souza Vilela, Jessica; Andronicos, Nicholas M.; Kolakshyapati, Manisha; Hilliar, Matthew; Sibanda, Terence Z.; Andrew, Nigel R.; Swick, Robert A.; Wilkinson, Stuart; Ruhnke, Isabelle",Anim Nutr,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/315ee0db8acc1f95e29393452e1c438e3776b0c3.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8379420.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aninu.2020.08.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34466674/,236293765.0

Influenza vaccines are designed accordingly, under the premise of antigenic drift. However, a paradox exists at the centre of influenza research. If influenza evolved primarily through mutation in multiple epitopes, multiple influenza strains should co-circulate. Such a multitude of strains would render influenza vaccines quickly inefficacious. Instead, a single or limited number of strains dominate circulation each influenza season. Unless additional constraints are placed on the evolution of influenza, antigenic drift does not adequately explain these observations. Here, we explore the constraints placed on antigenic drift and a competing theory of influenza evolution – antigenic thrift. In contrast to antigenic drift, antigenic thrift states that immune selection targets epitopes of limited variability, which constrain the variability of the virus. We explain the implications of antigenic drift and antigenic thrift and explore their current and potential uses in the context of influenza vaccine design.",2021-06-16,"Bolton, Jai S.; Klim, Hannah; Wellens, Judith; Edmans, Matthew; Obolski, Uri; Thompson, Craig P.",Vaccines (Basel),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/486cbce281b4b60f842f45f0b6594e6d34ae4942.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8235769.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9060657; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34208489/,235653832.0

While NTD mutations appear at first glance very diverse, they converge on the structure of the supersite. The mutations within the RBD, on the other hand, hone in on only a small number of key sites (K417, L452, E484, N501) that are allosteric control points enabling spike to escape neutralising antibodies while maintaining or even gaining Ace2-binding activity.

METHODS: A web-based national survey was developed by the Working Group Young Rheumatology of the German Society for Rheumatology and the German League against Rheumatism. The prospective survey was distributed via social media (Twitter, Instagram and Facebook), QR code and email. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and regression analyses were performed to show correlations. RESULTS: We analysed the responses of 299 patients and 129 rheumatologists. Most patients (74%) and rheumatologists (76%) believed that DHAs are useful in the management of rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) and felt confident in their own usage thereof (90%; 86%). 38% of patients and 71% of rheumatologists reported that their attitude had changed positively towards DHAs and that their usage had increased due to COVID-19 (29%; 48%). The majority in both groups agreed on implementing virtual visits for follow-up appointments in stable disease conditions. The most reported advantages of DHAs were usage independent of time and place (76.6%; 77.5%). The main barriers were a lack of information on suitable, available DHAs (58.5%; 41.9%), poor usability (42.1% of patients) and a lack of evidence supporting the effectiveness of DHAs (23.2% of rheumatologists). Only a minority (<10% in both groups) believed that digitalisation has a negative impact on the patient–doctor relationship. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic instigated an increase in patients’ and rheumatologists’ acceptance and usage of DHAs, possibly introducing a permanent paradigm shift in the management of RMDs.",2021-02-23,"Kernder, Anna; Morf, Harriet; Klemm, Philipp; Vossen, Diana; Haase, Isabell; Mucke, Johanna; Meyer, Marco; Kleyer, Arnd; Sewerin, Philipp; Bendzuck, Gerlinde; Eis, Sabine; Knitza, Johannes; Krusche, Martin",RMD Open,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/3187fd889c602668fd1539b4c94992a4aa75d6b3.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7907631.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33622673/; https://doi.org/10.1136/rmdopen-2020-001548,232037717.0

We found that the electron-withdrawing halogen substituents on the vicinal carbon cause the fluorine atom, participating in the hydrogen bond formation, to be less negatively charged. Thus, the halogen groups weaken the strength of organofluorine hydrogen bond by inductive effect. The position of the substituents on the vicinal carbon affects the strength of the C-F⋯H-O interaction. Compared with that in other isomers, the electron withdrawing substituent in 1-fluoro-ethane with stagger conformation as well as in 1-fluoro-ethene with trans configuration much weakens the interaction of C-F⋯H-O due to the hyperconjugative interaction between σ(C-F) and .

Research conducted during past epidemics found that pregnant women are more vulnerable psychologically. The aim of this study was to investigate antenatal depressive and anxiety symptoms during this pandemic in Greece. METHODS: All women receiving routine antenatal care, during a three-month period, starting one week after the total lockdown in Greece, in a University department, were asked to fill in two questionnaires, the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). RESULTS: Overall, 505 women (93.3% of the eligible population) agreed to participate. The prevalence of antenatal depression (EPDS score≥13) in the population of the study was 13.5%. Unplanned pregnancy (OR: 2.447; 95% CI: 1.235-4.846), smoking (OR: 2.268; 95% CI: 1.166-4.411) and antenatal anxiety (OR: 5.074; 95% CI: 2.898-8.883) increased the risk of antenatal depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. State (current)-anxiety affected 34.1% of the participants, whereas Trait (lifetime)-anxiety affected 15.8%. The State-anxiety score (median) was significantly higher than the Trait-anxiety (median) (41 vs. 36; p<0.001), revealing an increase in the levels of anxiety in the pandemic, while there was also a positive linear correlation between the two scales (rho=0.592; p<0.001).

We present a hemodynamically unstable patient with COVID-19 and pericardial effusion, subsequently diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung. CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old male with no significant medical history was diagnosed with COVID-19 two weeks prior to presentation. He had dyspnea on exertion since that time and presented to the hospital after having an abnormal CXR and leukocytosis on out-patient testing. His blood pressure was 95/68 with a heart rate of 129. EKG revealed atrial fibrillation and electrical alternans. He had mildly elevated BNP and troponin, with lactic acidosis. Bilateral opacities were noted on CXR. A large effusion concerning for tamponade was noted on bedside echo. He underwent immediate pericardiocentesis and had 2L serosanguinous fluid drained. After initial stabilization, he was found to have extensive bilateral lower extremity DVT and PE.Repeat TTE showed residual effusion with tamponade physiology observed. Despite the findings on imaging, a pericardial window was not pursued due to concerns of anesthesia induction in the setting of a new PE. He underwent placement of a pericardial drain instead. After the procedure, heparin drip was initiated with an IVC filter placed soon after. The patient eventually had a pericardial window placed. His arrhythmia was chemically converted back to sinus rhythm. On POD5, the drains were removed.Autoimmune workup of the fluid was within normal limits, but cytology resulted in a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma positive for TTF-1. Thus, he was diagnosed with stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung. CT revealed multiple lytic lesions with diffuse lymphadenopathy. MRI showed no evidence of brain metastasis. He was transitioned to apixaban at discharge, with out-patient oncology follow-up. DISCUSSION: A small study of 31 patients showed pericardial effusion was an independent risk factor predicting severity of COVID-19 infection, with reports of the virus being detected in pericardial fluid.[1,2] While virus infection can cause pericardial effusion, other causes should not be ignored in the workup. With hemodynamic instability, immediate intervention is warranted despite the risk involved with pericardiocentesis. In patients with large volume of pericardial effusion extracted, 5% of them will suffer from paradoxical hemodynamic instability and pulmonary edema afterwards, a condition known as pericardial decompression syndrome.[3] The increased venous return after decompression will compress the LV, based on the principle of ventricular coupling, reducing the cardiac output. Treatment for this condition is supportive. CONCLUSIONS: While COVID-19 is known to cause pericardial effusion, other causes, such as malignancy, should not be forgotten and should always remain in our differential. The risk involved with immediate pericardiocentesis goes beyond cardiac injury. REFERENCE #1: Chen Q, Xu L, Dai Y, et al. Cardiovascular manifestations in severe and critical patients with COVID -19.

This study explored the evaluation results from students regarding the curriculum reform and investigated graduates’ perceptions regarding the curriculum organization of the two academic training programs affected by this curricular reform. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from May 14 to June 12, 2019. The 315 graduates from both the 7-year and 6-year curriculum programs in the same medical school in Taipei were invited to participate in this study. In total, 197 completed questionnaires were received, representing a response rate of 62.5%. The results of the principal component analysis confirmed the validity of the constructs employed in this self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: The t-test results yielded two main findings. First, the graduates from the 6-year program had significantly lower scores for preparedness for the upcoming postgraduate-year residency training than did their 7-year program counterparts. Additionally, the male graduates had significantly higher scores in terms of perceptions regarding curriculum organization and preparedness for postgraduate-year residency training than the female graduates. The results of stepwise regression also indicated that the sex difference was significantly correlated with graduates’ readiness for their postgraduate-year residency training. CONCLUSION: To avoid sex disparities in career development, a further investigation of female medical students’ learning environment and conditions is necessary. In addition to the cross-sectional study of students’ perceptions, further repeated measurements of the objective academic or clinical performance of graduates in clinical settings are desirable.",2022-04-20,"Wu, Jeng-Cheng; Tang, Kung-Pei; Hsu, Yi-Hsin Elsa; Yang, Ya-Ting; Chu, Jan-Show; Lin, Yen-Kuang; Hou, Wen-Hsuan",BMC Med Educ,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/650bea6301608b8f3e9d0069ae83371d8c077817.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC9019532.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35443681/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-022-03330-w,248270854.0

METHODS We queried the PubMed and Embase databases for studies indexed through December 2020. We included studies providing data on severe disease, hospitalization, ICU care, need for mechanical ventilation, or mortality among subjects with COVID-19 with and without asthma. We calculated the relative risk for each reported outcome of interest and used random effects modeling to summarize the data. RESULTS We retrieved 1,832 citations, and included 90 studies, in our review. Most publications reported data retrieved from electronic records of retrospective subject cohorts. Only 25 studies were judged to be of high quality. Subjects with asthma and COVID-19 had a marginally higher risk of hospitalization (summary relative risk 1.13, 95% CI 1.03-1.24) but not for severe disease (summary relative risk 1.17, 95% CI 0.62-2.20), ICU admission (summary relative risk 1.13, 95% CI 0.96-1.32), mechanical ventilation (summary relative risk 1.05, 95% CI 0.85-1.29), or mortality (summary relative risk 0.92, 95% CI 0.82-1.04) as compared to subjects with COVID-19 without asthma.

CASE PRESENTATION: 53-year-old female with history of well controlled asthma presented initially with dyspnea and hypoxemia due to COVID-19 pneumonia requiring hospitalization.The patient presented back after a month with worsening dyspnea associated with mixed interstitial and airspace lung disease with groundglass opacities, severe hypoxemia requiring NIV and Oxygen therapy, her scans were negative for PE/VTE and her echocardiogram revealed elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure.The patient carries no history of autoimmune disease, nor any symptoms consistent with connective tissue disorder, although her serology came back positive for anti-RNP antibody of 6 AI and a positive anticryoglobulin antibodies. Highly elevated RF and negative anti-CCP, the rest of her serological work-up was negative. Corticosteroid therapy with 1 mg/kg prednisone was initiated with marked improvement in her oxygen requirement and dyspnea. DISCUSSION: Since the emerging cases of COVID-19 pneumonia have spread globally, There have been many reports about the development of autoimmune disease once the infection is controlled. SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe inflammatory state that is also known as ""cytokine storm"" and the development of thrombotic phenomena, clinical presentations can vary from severe lymphopenia and, in some cases, complement consumption and auto antibody developed development.The long-term outcome and the pulmonary sequela of SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. Many case reports have shed the light on whats known as post Covid 19 inflammatory interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis. It has It has been hypothesized that, The development of post-COVID-19 autoimmunity is proposed based on the consequences of both a transient immunosuppression in which self-tolerance is lost and an inappropriate form of immune reconstitution that amplifies the process. CONCLUSIONS: Many questions stems from such hypothesis regarding prognosis and treatment that can be offered to those patients, will those patients develop an autoimmune syndrome in the future? Is there a role for immunosuppressive therapy other than corticosteroids that can improve morbidity and mortality of such patients?

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the association between different degrees of hyperglycemia and the risk of all‐cause mortality among hospitalized patients with COVID‐19. DESIGN: A retrospective study. SETTING: Union Hospital in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: 453 patients were admitted to the hospital with laboratory‐confirmed SARS‐Cov‐2 infection from January 22, 2020 to March 17, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patients were classified into four categories: normal glucose, hyperglycemia (fasting glucose 5.6–6.9 mmol/L and/or HbA1c 5.7–6.4%), newly diagnosed diabetes (fasting glucose ≥7 mmol/L and/or HbA1c ≥6.5%), and known diabetes. The major outcomes included in‐hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). RESULTS: Patients with newly diagnosed diabetes had the highest percentage to be admitted to the ICU (11.7%) and require IMV (11.7%), followed by patients with known diabetes (4.1%; 9.2%) and patients with hyperglycemia (6.2%; 4.7%), compared with patients with normal glucose (1.5%; 2.3%), respectively. The multivariable‐adjusted hazard ratios of mortality among COVID‐19 patients with normal glucose, hyperglycemia, newly diagnosed diabetes, and known diabetes were 1.00, 3.29 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65–16.6), 9.42 (95% CI 2.18–40.7), and 4.63 (95% CI 1.02–21.0), respectively. CONCLUSION: We firstly showed that COVID‐19 patients with newly diagnosed diabetes had the highest risk of all‐cause mortality compared with COVID‐19 patients with known diabetes, hyperglycemia and normal glucose.

Methods & Materials Partial RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene sequences of 11 bat-CoV positive guano collected in Wind Cave Nature Reserve was analysed. Five pellets of fresh guano from insectivorous bats were collected on plastic tarp and pooled in 500uL of ice-cold viral transport medium. The 440-bp gene was amplified using family-wide hemi-nested RT-PCR for phylogenetic analysis. Amplicon sequences were analysed using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool software (BLAST) to determine their corresponding species. Sequence alignment was carried out without primer sequence and phylogenetic tree with Maximum Likelihood bootstrap-Bayesian inference value (MLb/PPv) support. Results The positive rate was 47.6% (10/21) with the distribution of 60% (n=6/10) and 40% (n=4/10) Alpha and Beta-coronaviruses respectively. BatCoVs identified in this study formed four novel monophyletic clades referred to as Borneo Alpha-1 and -2, and Borneo Beta-1 and -2. Borneo Alpha-1 and -2 viruses diverged to form a monophyletic clade with Decacovirus-1 and Decacovirus-2 respectively (83.0-85.1% and 80.7-81.0% nucleotide identity) with batCoV found in Sabah (NCBI Accession# KX284940). Borneo Beta-1 viruses are also closely related to BatCoV found in Sabah (KX284939) (86.5-87.5% nt identity), forming a monophyletic group with Sarbecovirus. Meanwhile, Borneo Beta-2 are closer to BatCoVs in Loas (MN312609) (89.7-90.4% nt identity), forming a monophyletic clade with Hibecovirus. It is worthy to note that viruses found in the Sarbecovirus subgenus such as SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 attributed to two zooneses with Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) over the past two decades. However, Borneo Beta-1 viruses are distant to the RaTG13 (MN996532) (69.1-697% nt identity), the proposed progenitor of the pandemic SARS-CoV-2.

There are controversies as to whether a mediastinal negative result in PET-CT may spare the invasive staging of the mediastinum. The main endpoint is to evaluate the negative predictive value (NPV) of PET-CT in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) clinical stage IB-IIA without clinical nodal involvement. The secondary endpoint is to evaluate the prevalence of mediastinal and hilar nodal affection in this population. METHODS: We performed an observational descriptive study from January 2010 to January 2020, including 76 patients with clinical stage IB-IIA, who underwent pulmonary resection with systematic nodal sampling (pre-determined lymph node stations based on tumour location) for primary NSCLC. Clinically, nodal involvement was defined as any lymph node greater than 1 cm in the short axis on a CT or with metabolic uptake greater than 2.5 SUV on PET-CT. The prevalence of nodal metastases was recorded. RESULTS: Fifty six patients had clinical stage IB and 20 had clinical stage IIA. Mean tumour size was 3.74 ± 0.5 cm.

A total of 936 Spanish teachers participated in this nationwide survey from all educational levels, thus allowing comparison among levels, which is a novelty and strength of our study. Four aspects were explored: (1) instructional adaptation to ERT; (2) well-being changes and the main challenges in this regard; (3) changes in emotions; and (4) changes in motivation and the main factors. Importantly, we explored a number of teacher characteristics (e.g., gender, age) for the three last aspects. Our results show that teachers felt the impact of ERT on their well-being, emotions, and motivation. Additionally, female teachers, teachers with students of low socioeconomic status (SES), in public schools, and primary and secondary teachers were the most affected groups.

Current guidelines on the management of refractory septic shock recommend the consideration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as a salvage therapy. The difference between adults and children with septic refractory shock treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has not been previously analyzed. We aimed to review peer-reviewed publications on the role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in adults and children with refractory septic shock. Methods: Studies reporting on mortality in both adults and children with refractory septic shock supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation published in PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases were included in the meta-analysis. Study eligibility was independently assessed by two authors, and disagreements were resolved by a third author. The outcome measure was survival at discharge. Subgroup analysis included the adult and pediatric groups. Results: Of the 293 articles screened, 14 original articles were identified for systematic review and meta-analysis. The cumulative estimate of survival (14 studies, 535 patients) in the cohort was 39% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 27-51%). During the subgroup analysis, the cumulative estimate of survival at discharge in the adult group (6 studies, 276 patients) in the cohort was 18% (95% CI: 10-27%), and that in the pediatric group (8 studies, 259 patients) was 53% (95% CI: 47-59%).

Many countries, including Bangladesh, reported suicide as extreme consequences of the psychological burden influenced by COVID-19. The present study explores human stress and its factor influenced by COVID-19 in Bangladesh, which significantly affect the quality of life. METHODS: An online-based questionnaire survey was conducted among 651 adult Bangladeshi populations by capturing socio-demographic information, possible human stress, and consequences of the pandemic. A set of statistical tools such as Pearson's Correlation Matrix (PCM), T-test, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) were applied to identify the relationship between different factors and influential factors increasing human stress. RESULTS: More than 83% of the participants are facing COVID-19 related mental stress, which results in short temper, sleep disorder, and family chaos. PCA and HCA outcomes indicated a significant relationship between the respondents' opinions and human stress factors, which harmonized with the country's existing scenario. PCM results enlighten the relationship between human stress factors and found financial hardship, cutting back daily spending, and food crisis are interconnected together causes stress. Also, hampering students' formal education and future career plans significantly contribute to mental stress.

In Fujian Province in eastern China, even its circulating status and genetic characteristics are unclear. Here, we tested 127 tissue samples from swine from Fujian Province that presented respiratory symptoms. All of the PCV3 positive samples were negative for many other pathogens involved in respiratory diseases like PCV2, PRRSV, and CSFV, suggesting that PCV3 is potentially pathogenic. From phylogenetic analysis, PCV3 strains are divided into two main clades and five sub-clades; PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2, PCV3a-3, PCV3b-1, and PCV3b-2. Our identified strains belong to genotypes PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2, PCV3a-3, and PCV3b-2, indicating a high degree of genetic diversity of PCV3 in Fujian province until 2019. Interestingly, we found the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of PCV3 was dated to the 1950s, and PCV3 has a similar evolutionary rate as PCV2 (the main epidemic genotypes PCV2b and PCV2d). In addition, positive selection sites N56D/S and S77T/N on the capsid gene are located on the PCV3 antigen epitope, indicating that PCV3 is gradually adaptive in swine.

Body temperature can be measured using thermal infrared imaging, a safe, non-contact method that relies on the emissivity of the skin being known to provide accurate readings. Skin pigmentation affects the absorption of visible light and enables us to see variations in skin colour. Pigmentation may also affect the absorption of infrared radiation and thus affect thermal imaging. Human skin has an accepted emissivity of 0.98 but the effect of different skin pigmentation on this value is not known. In this study, we investigated the influence of different skin pigmentation on thermal emissivity in 65 adult volunteers. METHODS: A reference object of known emissivity (electrical tape) was applied to participant’s skin on the inner upper arm. Tape and arm were imaged simultaneously using a thermal infrared camera. The emissivity was set on the camera to the known value for electrical tape. The emissivity was altered manually until the skin temperature using thermal imaging software was equal to the initial tape temperature. This provided the calculated emissivity value of the skin. Participants were grouped according to skin pigmentation, quantified using the Fitzpatrick skin phototyping scale and reflectance spectrophotometry. Differences in emissivity values between skin pigmentation groups were assessed by one-way ANOVA. RESULTS: The mean calculated emissivity for the 65 participants was 0.972 (range 0.96–0.99). No significant differences in emissivity were observed between participants when grouped by skin pigmentation according to the Fitzpatrick scale (p = 0.859) or reflectance spectrophotometry (p = 0.346). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that skin pigmentation does not affect thermal emissivity measurement of skin temperature using thermal infrared imaging.

The impact of COVID‐19 on the availability of donor organs and the impact on solid organ transplant remains unclear. We examine the impact of COVID‐19 on a single, large‐volume heart transplant program. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed examining all adult heart transplants performed at a single institution between March 2020 and June 2020. This was compared to the same time frame in 2019. We examined incidence of primary graft dysfunction, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and 30‐day survival. RESULTS: From March to June 2020, 43 orthotopic heart transplants were performed compared to 31 performed during 2019. Donor and recipient demographics demonstrated no differences. There was no difference in 30‐day survival. There was a statistically significant difference in incidence of postoperative CRRT (9/31 vs. 3/43; p = .01). There was a statistically significant difference in race (23 W/8B/1AA vs. 30 W/13B; p = .029). CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that a single, large‐volume transplant program was able to grow volume with little difference in donor variables and clinical outcomes following transplant. While multiple reasons are possible, most likely the reduction of volume at other programs allowed us to utilize organs to which we would not have previously had access.

We aimed to investigate the potential association between autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases and COVID-19 early in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We did an exposure-driven, propensity score-matched study using a South Korean nationwide cohort linked to general health examination records. We analysed all South Korean patients aged older than 20 years who underwent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing between Jan 1 and May 30, 2020, and received general health examination results from the Korean National Health Insurance Service. We defined autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (inflammatory arthritis and connective tissue diseases) based on the relevant ICD-10 codes, with at least two claims (outpatient or inpatient) within 1 year. The outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, severe COVID-19 (requirement of oxygen therapy, intensive care unit admission, application of invasive ventilation, or death), and COVID-19-related death. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were estimated after adjusting for the potential confounders. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1 and May 30, 2020, 133 609 patients (70 050 [52·4%] female and 63 559 [47·6%] male) completed the general health examination and were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 4365 (3·3%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 8297 (6·2%) were diagnosed with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases. After matching, patients with an autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic disease showed an increased likelihood of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (adjusted OR 1·19, 95% CI 1·03–1·40; p=0·026), severe COVID-19 outcomes (1·26, 1·02–1·59; p=0·041), and COVID-19-related death (1·69, 1·01–2·84; p=0·046). Similar results were observed in patients with connective tissue disease and inflammatory arthritis. Treatment with any dose of systemic corticosteroids or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were not associated with COVID-19-related outcomes, but those receiving high dose (≥10 mg per day) of systemic corticosteroids had an increased likelihood of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adjusted OR 1·47, 95% CI 1·05–2·03; p=0·022), severe COVID-19 outcomes (1·76, 1·06–2·96; p=0·031), and COVID-19-related death (3·34, 1·23–8·90; p=0·017). INTERPRETATION: Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases were associated with an increased likelihood of a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, worse clinical outcomes of COVID-19, and COVID-19-related deaths in South Korea. A high dose of systemic corticosteroid, but not DMARDs, showed an adverse effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related clinical outcomes.

So, the design of new 3 CLpro inhibitors was proposed using a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study. In this context, a powerful adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (ALASSO) penalized variable selection method with inherent advantages coupled with a nonlinear artificial neural network (ANN) modelling method were used to provide a QSAR model with high interpretability and predictability. After evaluating the accuracy and validity of the developed ALASSO-ANN model, new compounds were proposed using effective descriptors, and the biological activity of the new compounds was predicted. Ligand-receptor (LR) interactions were also performed to confirm the interaction strength of the compounds using molecular docking (MD) study.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the risk of malnutrition and sarcopenia in elderly COVID-19 patients with the R-MAPP (Remote-Malnutrition APP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 337 consecutive outpatients ≥65 years who attended the Central Emergency COVID-19 Hospital of Castilla y Leon was conducted. In all patients, the protocol of R-MAPP (Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool [MUST] and Simple Questionnaire to Rapidly Diagnose Sarcopenia [SARC-F]) was realized. RESULTS: The mean age was 86.1 ± 8.7 years, with a sex distribution of 167 males (49.5%) and 170 females (51.5%). According to the MUST test, patients with 0 points have a low nutritional risk (n = 50, 14.8%), 1 point a medium nutritional risk (n = 19, 5.6%), and 2 or more points a high nutritional risk (n = 268, 79.6%). The SARC-F questionnaire generates patients with 4 or more points as predictive of sarcopenia (n = 304, 80.2%) and <4 points without prediction of sarcopenia (n = 33, 9.8%). Global mortality was 24.03% (n = 81). The mortality rate was related to the pathological SARC-F score ≥4 (27.1% vs. 3.1%; p = 0.01) and MUST score ≥2 (26.7% vs. 16.4%; p = 0.04). In the logistic regression analysis, only the SARC-F score ≥4 remained as an independent variable related to mortality; odds ratio was 8.34 (95% CI: 1.1-63.8; p = 0.04), adjusted for age, sex, albumin levels, and MUST test.

Previously, the authors' group compared perioperative outcomes and hospital costs of patients undergoing ventral hernia repair with retromuscular mesh using suture fixation versus fibrin glue. This article reports on 3-year postoperative outcomes, including hernia recurrence, long-term clinical outcomes, and patient-reported quality of life. METHODS: Patients who underwent ventral hernia repair performed by a single surgeon between 2015 to 2017 were identified. Patients with retromuscular resorbable mesh placed were included and matched by propensity score. Primary outcomes included hernia recurrence, surgical-site infection, surgical-site occurrence, and surgical-site occurrence/surgical-site infection requiring procedural interventions. Secondary outcomes included quality of life as assessed by the Hernia-Related Quality of Life Survey. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients were eligible, and 46 patients were matched (23 suture fixation and 23 fibrin glue), with a median age of 62 years, a median body mass index of 29 kg/m2, and a median defect size of 300 cm2 (interquartile range, 180 to 378 cm2). Median follow-up was 36 months (interquartile range, 31 to 36 months). There was no difference in the incidence of hernia recurrence (13.0 percent for suture fixation and 8.7 percent for fibrin glue; p = 0.636) or other postoperative outcomes between techniques (all p > 0.05). Five patients required reoperation because of a complication (10.9 percent). Overall quality of life improved preoperatively to postoperatively at all time points (all p < 0.05), and no differences in quality-of-life improvement were seen between techniques (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Ventral hernia repair with atraumatic resorbable retromuscular mesh fixation using fibrin glue demonstrates equivalent postoperative clinical and quality-of-life outcomes when compared to mechanical suture fixation.

The causal relation of ZIKV to microcephaly is still a much-debated issue. The identification of outbreak foci being in certain endemic urban areas characterized by a high-density population emphasizes that mixed infections might spearhead the recent appearance of a wide range of diseases that were initially attributed to ZIKV. Globally, such coinfections may have both positive and negative effects on viral replication, tropism, host response, and the viral genome. In other words, the possibility of coinfection may necessitate revisiting what is considered to be known regarding the pathogenesis and epidemiology of ZIKV diseases. ZIKV viral coinfections are already being reported with other arboviruses (e.g., chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and dengue virus (DENV)) as well as congenital pathogens (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cytomegalovirus (HCMV)).

Further, studies to date have disproportionately examined males and failed to examine sex differences. Here we examine the relationship between aerobic fitness and neuropsychological functioning in physically healthy youth and whether sex moderates these findings. Design: Sixty-four healthy emerging adults (16-25 years-old; 32 female) underwent measurement of objective aerobic fitness (VO2 max) and neuropsychological assessment. Exclusion criteria included: left-handedness, prenatal medical issues or alcohol/illicit drug exposure, Axis-I psychiatric disorders, major medical disorders including metabolic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, major neurologic disorders, LOS greater than 2 min, intellectual disability or learning disability, regular substance use (e.g., greater than biweekly use of cannabis) or positive drug toxicology testing. Method: Multiple regressions examined VO2 max, sex, sex*VO2interaction in relation to neurocognition, controlling for objectively measured body fat percentage. Results: Prior to including body fat percentage, higher VO2 max related to improved working memory (Letter-Number Sequencing; p = .03) and selective attention (CPT-II hit response time standard error; p = .03). Aerobic fitness significantly interacted with sex, as higher-fit males had better performance on two sustained attention tasks while females did not demonstrate this pattern (CPT-II variability standard error, p = .047; Ruff 2&7 Total Speed, p = .02). Body fat percentage was positively slower cognitive flexibility (D-KEFS color-word switching/inhibition, p = .046). Conclusions: VO2 independently predicted better working memory and selective attention. Increased aerobic fitness level related to increased performance on sustained attention tasks in males but not females. Therefore, aerobic fitness may be positively related to better cognitive functioning in physically healthy adolescents and emerging adults without metabolic conditions.

A few studies focused on the occurrence of Q fever infection in water buffaloes in Thailand have been conducted; however, little is known regarding the seroprevalence of C. burnetii antibodies in buffaloes. In the present study, we describe the prevalence of Q fever infection in water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) in Phatthalung, Thailand. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 421 samples (156 blood, 156 sera, and 109 ectoparasites [lice]) were collected from 156 water buffaloes from 29 farms of the Phatthalung Province from January 22, 2021, to March 26, 2021. The blood and ectoparasite samples were screened for C. burnetii DNA using a polymerase chain reaction assay and the sera were tested for C. burnetii antibody using an indirect immunofluorescence assay. RESULTS: C. burnetii DNA was not detected in blood or ectoparasites; however, the seroprevalence of individual water buffaloes was 4.49% (95% CI: 2.19-8.99%), whereas that of the herd was 13.79%.

The four-component lipid nanoparticle synthetic delivery systems consisting of ionizable lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, and a PEG-conjugated lipid, assembled by microfluidic or T-tube technology, have been extraordinarily successful for delivery of mRNA to provide Covid-19 vaccines. Recently, we reported a one-component multifunctional sequence-defined ionizable amphiphilic Janus dendrimer (IAJD) synthetic delivery system for mRNA relying on amphiphilic Janus dendrimers and glycodendrimers developed in our laboratory. Amphiphilic Janus dendrimers consist of functional hydrophilic dendrons conjugated to hydrophobic dendrons. Co-assembly of IAJDs with mRNA into dendrimersome nanoparticles (DNPs) occurs by simple injection in acetate buffer, rather than by microfluidic devices, and provides a very efficient system for delivery of mRNA to lung. Here we report the replacement of most of the hydrophilic fragment of the dendron from IAJDs, maintaining only its ionizable amine, while changing its interconnecting group to the hydrophobic dendron from amide to ester. The resulting IAJDs demonstrated that protonated ionizable amines play dual roles of hydrophilic fragment and binding ligand for mRNA, changing delivery from lung to spleen and/or liver. Replacing the interconnecting ester with the amide switched the delivery back to lung. Delivery predominantly to liver is favored by pairs of odd and even alkyl groups in the hydrophobic dendron. This simple structural change transformed the targeted delivery of mRNA mediated with IAJDs, from lung to liver and spleen, and expands the utility of DNPs from therapeutics to vaccines.",2021,"Zhang, Dapeng; Atochina-Vasserman, Elena N; Maurya, Devendra S; Liu, Matthew; Xiao, Qi; Lu, Juncheng; Lauri, George; Ona, Nathan; Reagan, Erin K; Ni, Houping; Weissman, Drew; Percec, Virgil",J Am Chem Soc,,#covidwho-1483092,,,,https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c09585; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34672554/,239457963.0

METHODS: Patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) department and general infection department of TaiKang Tongji (Wuhan) Hospital from February 10 to March 27, 2020, were included. Data on clinical features, complications, laboratory parameters, chest CT, nutrient requirement, and electrolyte imbalance were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 123 (50 critical and 73 non‐critical) patients were enrolled. 65% of patients with comorbidities, hypertension (45.5%), diabetes (21.9%), 36.5% of patients had more than one comorbidity. The proportion of lymphocytes in critical patients was significantly lower than that of non‐critical patients. The proportion of patients with increased NLR, PLR, IL‐6, CRP levels, and chest CT score was significantly higher in the critical than that of non‐critical patients. The logistic regression analysis identified low lymphocyte count, high NLR, PLR, IL‐6, CRP levels, and CT score as independent factors for discerning critical cases and high NLR, PLR, IL‐6, and CT score could predict poor clinical outcome. Furthermore, we identified patients who needed nutrition support (HR 16.99) and with correction of electrolyte imbalance (HR 18.24) via intravenous injection were more likely to have a poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The potential risk factors of lower lymphocyte count, high levels of NLR, PLR, IL‐6, CRP, chest CT score, and the statue of nutrient requirement or electrolyte imbalance could assist clinicians in discerning critical cases and predict the poor outcome in patients with COVID‐19.",2020-08-29,"Wang, Weili; Zhao, Zhongxiu; Liu, Xi; Liu, Gang; Xie, Dongjing; Xu, Zhi; Zhao, Jinghong; Zhang, Jingbo",J Clin Lab Anal,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/d4538716e1a36a7f31373a800587739ca6c372e9.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7595899.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.23547; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32860454/,221367024.0

PEDV strains with variants in the spike (S) gene have been reported in several countries. To better understand the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of PEDV field isolates, in this study, we characterised the complete genome sequence of a novel PEDV variant JSCZ1601 from a outbreak in China in 2016. The PEDV isolate was 28,033 nucleotides (nt) in length without the polyadenylated sequences. Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length genome sequence of JSCZ1601 grouped it with the pandemic variants determined post-2010 into group 2 (G2). However, the S gene of JSCZ1601 formed a new subgroup separated from the subgroups containing the other G2 strains. Comparative analysis of the amino acids encoded by the S genes revealed the N-terminal of the deduced JSCZ1601 S protein had a novel two-amino-acid deletion (N58 and S59) compared with all identified genogroups. Further, compared with the reference strains, a ‘G’ insertion was detected in the 5′ terminal of the 5′UTR of the JSCZ1601. The animal experiment revealed that this strain was high pathogenic to neonatal pigs. Taken together, a PEDV strain with the new molecular characterizations and phylogenies was found in mainland China.

However, they require a clear understanding of depositional processes to allow their interpretation. Experimental archaeology was conducted to understand the process of artifact deposition and the interpretation of underfloor deposits in twelve standing buildings in Western Australia. Floors were built and a range of artifacts swept across them to determine how artifacts travelled across floorboards or fell through gaps between boards. Size, shape, and angularity of artifacts were key determinants of the likelihood of deposition.

Humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop a disease known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with symptoms and consequences including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cardiovascular disorders, and death. SARS-CoV-2 appears to infect cells by first binding viral spike proteins with host protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors; the virus is endocytosed following priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). The process of virus entry into endosomes and its release from endolysosomes are key features of enveloped viruses. Thus, it is important to focus attention on the role of endolysosomes in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, coronaviruses are now known to hijack endocytic machinery to enter cells such that they can deliver their genome at replication sites without initiating host detection and immunological responses. Hence, endolysosomes might be good targets for developing therapeutic strategies against coronaviruses.

We sought to evaluate the overall success of this change, and to identify what types of practice settings, provider groups, and patient groups were best served by telepsychiatry and telepsychotherapy utilization. We were particularly interested in how providers of consultation-liaison psychiatry (CLP) adapted to remote care. METHODS: An anonymous provider survey querying demographics, education, training, technological experience, practice setting, treatment modalities, patient groups, transition process, and outcomes was made openly available via social media and professional listservs. We used multivariable regression modeling to evaluate for predictors of the positive outcomes of overall satisfaction, subjective ability to diagnose and treat patients adequately utilizing exclusively telepsychiatric platforms, and patient satisfaction by proxy. RESULTS: 333 respondents, mostly young (59.4% under 50), female (69.7%), and physicians (67.9%), completed the survey. 197(59.1%) worked in CLP. 85.9% gave affirmative answers to overall satisfaction. Multivariable linear regression models found that satisfaction was predicted by general comfort with technology (p<0.001), but negatively correlated with having technical issues (p<0.001), a priori skepticism (p<0.001), clinician being male (p=0.004), and treating LGBTQ+ patients (p=0.022). Completeness was associated with having training in telehealth (p=0.039) and general comfort with technology (p<0.001) but negatively associated with treating LGBTQ+ patients (p=0.024) or inpatients (p=0.002). Patient satisfaction by proxy was positively associated with general comfort with technology (p<0.001) and the respondent being a non-physician (p=0.004), and negatively associated with encountering a technical issue (p=0.013) or treating inpatients (p=0.045). CLPs had similar results overall, and were more likely to have other staff assist in making televisits effective (mean(SD): -1.25(3.57) versus -2.76(3.27), p<0.001) especially if consultative (mean(SD): -0.87(3.67) versus -2.39(3.01), p=0.010).

This study examines the current and future burden of lung cancer at global, regional, and national levels. METHODS: The estimates of lung cancer incident cases, deaths, and their age-standardized rates are drawn from GLOBOCAN 2020 for 21 regions and 185 countries. Mortality-to-incidence ratio (MIR) is considered as a proxy indicator of 5-year survival rates. Lung cancer burden in 2050 is projected using age-specific incidence and death rates in 2020. RESULTS: In 2020, there were 2.21 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths due to lung cancer worldwide with age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of 22.4/100,000 (male: 31.5; female: 14.6) and age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) of 18.0/100,000, (male: 25.9; female: 11.2/100,000). Global MIR of lung cancer was 0.82 (males 0.83; females: 0.79), varying from 0.59 (Japan) to 1.0 (Belize). Hungary had the highest age-standardized rates (ASIR: 50.1/100,000; ASMR: 42.4/100,000) and Nigeria (ASIR: 0.88; ASMR: 0.86) had the lowest age-standardized rates in 2020. Both ASIR and ASMR were positively correlated with country-level tobacco smoking prevalence and human development index (HDI), whereas MIR exhibited a negative correlation with HDI. As per our projections, there will be 3.8 million incident cases and 3.2 million deaths globally due to lung cancer in 2050. CONCLUSION: With close to 2 million cases and deaths already in 2020, lung cancer has already become a global public health threat. Even with current risk levels and age-specific rates, lung cancer annual cases are expected to reach 3.8 million in 2050. Until smoking prevalence is reduced and ambient air pollution levels are checked, particularly in low/medium HDI countries, the lung cancer epidemic will continue unfolding.

Understanding the economic impacts of this novel disease is important for making decisions on health resource allocation, including infectious disease prevention and control investment. However, there are limited data on such impacts. METHODS: Hospitalized laboratory-confirmed H7N9 patients or their families in Jiangsu Province of China were interviewed. Patients’ direct medical costs of hospitalization were derived from their hospital bills. A generalized linear model was employed to estimate the mean direct medical costs of patients with different characteristics. RESULTS: The mean direct cost of hospitalization for H7N9 was estimated to be ¥ 71 060 (95 % CI, 48 180–104 820), i.e., US$ 10 996 (95 % CI, 7 455–16 220), and was ¥12 060 (US$ 1 861), ¥136 120 (US$ 21 001) and ¥218 610 (US$ 33 728) for those who had mild or severe symptoms or who died, respectively. The principal components of the total fees differed among patients with different disease severity, although medication fees were always the largest contributors. Disease severity, proportion of reimbursement and family member monthly average income were identified as the key factors that contributed to a patient’s direct medical cost of hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: The direct medical costs of hospitalized patients with H7N9 are significant, and far surpass the annual per capita income of Jiangsu Province, China.

In this prospective study of a cohort of 46 SARS-CoV-2 patients infected with the Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2 we longitudinally analyzed changes in humoral and cellular immunity upon early and late convalescence. Antibody neutralization capacity was measured by surrogate virus neutralization test and cellular responses were investigated with 31-colour spectral flow cytometry. Spike-specific, isotype-switched B cells developed already during the disease phase, showed a memory phenotype and did not decrease in numbers even during late convalescence. Otherwise, no long-lasting perturbations of the immune compartment following COVID-19 clearance were observed. During convalescence anti-Spike (S1) IgG antibodies strongly decreased in all patients. We detected neutralizing antibodies against the Wuhan strain as well as the Alpha and Delta but not against the Beta, Gamma or Omicron variants for up to 7 months post COVID-19. Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed a strong association between sera anti-S1 IgG titers and their neutralization capacity against the Wuhan strain as well as Alpha and Delta. Overall, our data suggest that even 7 month after the clearance of COVID-19 many patients possess a protective layer of immunity, indicated by the persistence of Spike-specific memory B cells and by the presence of neutralizing antibodies against the Alpha and Delta variants. However, lack of neutralizing antibodies against the Beta, Gamma and Omicron variants even during the peak response is of major concern as this indicates viral evasion of the humoral immune response.",2022-03-14,"Odak, Ivan; Schultze-Florey, Christian R.; Hammerschmidt, Swantje I.; Ritter, Christiane; Willenzon, Stefanie; Friedrichsen, Michaela; Ravens, Inga; Sikora, Ruth; Bayir, Lâle M.; Gutierrez Jauregui, Rodrigo; Bernhardt, Günter; Stankov, Metodi V.; Cossmann, Anne; Hansen, Guido; Krey, Thomas; Cornberg, Markus; Koenecke, Christian; Behrens, Georg M.

Vaccines are key for reducing coronaviral disease burden; however, the utility of live-attenuated vaccines is limited by risks of reversion or repair. Because of their history of emergence events due to their prevalence in zoonotic pools, designing live-attenuated coronavirus vaccines that can be rapidly and broadly implemented is essential for outbreak preparedness. Here, we show that coronaviruses with completely rewired transcription regulatory networks (TRNs) are effective vaccines against SARS-CoV. The TRN-rewired viruses are attenuated and protect against lethal SARS-CoV challenge. While a 3-nt rewired TRN reverts via second-site mutation upon serial passage, a 7-nt rewired TRN is more stable, suggesting that a more extensively rewired TRN might be essential for avoiding growth selection. In summary, rewiring the TRN is a feasible strategy for limiting reversion in an effective live-attenuated coronavirus vaccine candidate that is potentially portable across the Nidovirales order.",2018-10-29,"Graham, Rachel L.; Deming, Damon J.; Deming, Meagan E.; Yount, Boyd L.; Baric, Ralph S.",Commun Biol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/dadb8cce14cbf09b6fbaf927b0b2524899ac028d.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6206136.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-018-0175-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30393776/,53095804.0

This study investigated the risks of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19‐related outcomes in patients with MS, and compared these with the general population. METHODS: A regional registry was created to collect data on incidence, hospitalization rates, intensive care unit admission, and death in patients with MS and COVID‐19. National government outcomes and seroprevalence data were used for comparison. The study was conducted at 14 specialist MS treatment centers in Madrid, Spain, between February and May 2020. RESULTS: Two‐hundred nineteen patients were included in the registry, 51 of whom were hospitalized with COVID‐19. The mean age ± standard deviation was 45.3 ± 12.4 years, and the mean duration of MS was 11.9 ± 8.9 years. The infection incidence rate was lower in patients with MS than the general population (adjusted incidence rate ratio = 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.70–0.80), but hospitalization rates were higher (relative risk = 5.03, 95% CI = 3.76–6.62). Disease severity was generally low, with only one admission to an intensive care unit and five deaths. Males with MS had higher incidence rates and risk of hospitalization than females.

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Care Excellence and the British Orthopaedic Association advise self-isolation for 14-days pre-operatively in patients at high-risk of adverse outcomes due to COVID-19. The aim of the study is to assess whether pre-operative PCR for SARS-CoV-2 could be performed at between 48 and-72 hours pre-operatively with specific advice about minimising the risk of SARS-CoV-2 restricted to between PCR and admission. Methods A multi-centre, international, observational cohort study of 1000 lower limb arthroplasty cases was performed. The dual primary outcomes were thirty-day conversion to SARS-CoV-2 positive and thirty-day SARS-CoV-2 mortality. Secondary outcomes included thirty-day SARS-CoV-2 morbidity. Results Of the 1000 cases, 935 (94%) had a PCR between 48 and 72-hours pre-operatively. All cases were admitted to, and had surgery through a COVID-free pathway. Primary knee arthroplasty was performed in 41% of cases, primary hip arthroplasty in 40%, revision knee arthroplasty in 11% and revision hip arthroplasty in 9%. Six-percent of operations were emergency operations. No cases of SARS-CoV-2 were identified within the first thirty-days. Conclusion Pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test between 48 and 72-hours pre-operatively with advice about minimising the risk of SARS-CoV-2 restricted to between PCR and admission in conjunction with a COVID-free pathway is safe for patients undergoing primary and revision hip and knee arthroplasty.

We were familiarizing ourselves with digital pathology solutions at the time when the COVID-19 outbreak forced us to embark on an abrupt transition to digital pathology. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to quantitatively describe how the abrupt transition to digital pathology might affect the quality of diagnoses, model possible causes by probabilistic modeling, and qualitatively gauge the perception of this abrupt transition. METHODS: A total of 17 pathologists and residents participated in this study; these participants reviewed 25 additional test cases from the archives and completed a final psychologic survey. For each case, participants performed several different diagnostic tasks, and their results were recorded and compared with the original diagnoses performed using the gold standard method (ie, conventional microscopy). We performed Bayesian data analysis with probabilistic modeling. RESULTS: The overall analysis, comprising 1345 different items, resulted in a 9% (117/1345) error rate in using digital slides. The task of differentiating a neoplastic process from a nonneoplastic one accounted for an error rate of 10.7% (42/392), whereas the distinction of a malignant process from a benign one accounted for an error rate of 4.2% (11/258). Apart from residents, senior pathologists generated most discrepancies (7.9%, 13/164). Our model showed that these differences among career levels persisted even after adjusting for other factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are in line with previous findings, emphasizing that the duration of transition (ie, lengthy or abrupt) might not influence the diagnostic performance.

We examine these challenges and propose interventions to protect healthcare workers on the continent, drawing on articles identified on Medline (Pubmed) in a search on 24 March 2020. Global jostling means that supplies of personal protective equipment are limited in Africa. Even low-cost interventions such as facemasks for patients with a cough and water supplies for handwashing may be challenging, as is ‘physical distancing’ in overcrowded primary health care clinics. Without adequate protection, COVID-19 mortality may be high among healthcare workers and their family in Africa given limited critical care beds and difficulties in transporting ill healthcare workers from rural to urban care centres. Much can be done to protect healthcare workers, however. The continent has learnt invaluable lessons from Ebola and HIV control. HIV counselors and community healthcare workers are key resources, and could promote social distancing and related interventions, dispel myths, support healthcare workers, perform symptom screening and trace contacts. Staff motivation and retention may be enhanced through carefully managed risk ‘allowances’ or compensation. International support with personnel and protective equipment, especially from China, could turn the pandemic’s trajectory in Africa around. Telemedicine holds promise as it rationalises human resources and reduces patient contact and thus infection risks. Importantly, healthcare workers, using their authoritative voice, can promote effective COVID-19 policies and prioritization of their safety. Prioritizing healthcare workers for SARS-CoV-2 testing, hospital beds and targeted research, as well as ensuring that public figures and the population acknowledge the commitment of healthcare workers may help to maintain morale. Clearly there are multiple ways that international support and national commitment could help safeguard healthcare workers in Africa, essential for limiting the pandemic’s potentially devastating heath, socio-economic and security impacts on the continent.",2020-05-15,"Chersich, Matthew F.; Gray, Glenda; Fairlie, Lee; Eichbaum, Quentin; Mayhew, Susannah; Allwood, Brian; English, Rene; Scorgie, Fiona; Luchters, Stanley; Simpson, Greg; Haghighi, Marjan Mosalman; Pham, Minh Duc; Rees, Helen",Global Health,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/94bada9ae4c16f3c2506ac7c444a69d743979238.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7227172.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00574-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32414379/,218653920.0

However, other potential means of transmission may be present. Fomite-mediated transmission occurs when viruses are deposited onto a surface and then transfer to a subsequent individual. Surfaces can become contaminated directly from respiratory droplets or from a contaminated hand. Due to mask mandates in many countries around the world, the former is less likely. Hands can become contaminated if respiratory droplets are deposited on them (i.e., coughing or sneezing) or through contact with fecal material where human coronaviruses (HCoVs) can be shed. The focus of this paper is on whether human coronaviruses can transfer efficiently from contaminated hands to food or food contact surfaces. The surfaces chosen were: stainless steel, plastic, cucumber and apple. Transfer was first tested with cellular maintenance media and three viruses: two human coronaviruses, 229E and OC43, and murine norovirus-1, as a surrogate for human norovirus. There was no transfer for either of the human coronaviruses to any of the surfaces. Murine norovirus-1 did transfer to stainless steel, cucumber and apple, with transfer efficiencies of 9.19%, 5.95% and 0.329%, respectively. Human coronavirus OC43 transfer was then tested in the presence of fecal material, and transfer was observed for stainless steel (0.52%), cucumber (19.82%) and apple (15.51%) but not plastic.

Here, we discuss unique insights the pandemic has provided into the eco‐evolutionary role of pathogens in ecosystems and present data that indicates the pandemic may have fundamentally changed our learning choices. COVID‐19 has indirectly affected many organisms and processes by changing the behavior of humans to avoid being infected. The pandemic also changed our learning behavior by affecting the relative importance of information and forcing teaching and learning into a framework that accommodates human behavioral measures to avoid disease transmission. Not only are these indirect effects on the environment occurring through a unique mechanistic pathway in ecology, the pandemic along with its effects on us provides a profound example of the role risk can play in the transmission of information between the at risk. Ultimately, these changes in our learning behavior led to this special issue “Taking learning online in Ecology and Evolution.” The special issue was a call to the community to take learning in new directions, including online and distributed experiences. The topics examined include a significant component of DIY ecology and evolution that is experiential but done individually, opportunities to use online tools and apps to be more inclusive, student‐focused strategies for teaching online, how to reinvent conferences, strategies to retain experiential learning safely, emerging forms of teaching such as citizen science, apps and podcasting, and ideas on how to accommodate ever changing constraints in the college classroom, to name a few.

Jasminin is a common bioactive component found in Chinese herbal medicine beverage “Jasmine Tea”. Here, we report that jasminin-induced endogenous TNF-α showed antiviral activity in vitro. The underlying TNF-α-inducing action of jasminin was also investigated in RAW264.7 cells. The level of endogenous TNF-α stimulated by jasminin was first analyzed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) from the cell culture supernatant of RAW264.7 cells. The supernatants were then collected to investigate the potential antiviral effect against herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). The antiviral effects of jasminin alone or its supernatants were evaluated by a plaque reduction assay. The potential activation of the PI3K–Akt pathway, three main mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and nuclear factor (NF)–κB signaling pathways that induce TNF-α production were also investigated. Jasminin induces TNF-α protein expression in RAW264.7 cells without additional stimuli 10-fold more than the control. No significant up-expression of type I, II, and III interferons; interleukins 2 and 10; nor TNF-β were observed by the jasminin stimuli. The supernatants, containing jasminin-induced-TNF-α, showed antiviral activity against HSV-1. The jasminin-stimulated cells caused the simultaneous activation of the Akt, MAPKs, and NF–κB signal pathways. Furthermore, the pretreatment of the cells with the Akt, MAPKs, and NF–κB inhibitors effectively suppressed jasminin-induced TNF-α production. Our research provides evidence that endogenous TNF-α can be used as a strategy to encounter viral infections.

We consider a Bayesian evidence synthesis approach which, while simple enough for researchers to understand and use, accounts for many important sources of uncertainty inherent in both the seroprevalence and mortality data. With the understanding that the results of one's evidence synthesis analysis may be largely driven by which studies are included and which are excluded, we conduct two separate parallel analyses based on two lists of eligible studies obtained from two different research teams. The results from both analyses are rather similar. With the first analysis, we estimate the COVID-19 IFR to be 0.31% [95% credible interval (CrI) of (0.16%, 0.53%)] for a typical community-dwelling population where 9% of the population is aged over 65 years and where the gross-domestic-product at purchasing-power-parity (GDP at PPP) per capita is $17.8k (the approximate worldwide average). With the second analysis, we obtain 0.32% [95% CrI of (0.19%, 0.47%)]. Our results suggest that, as one might expect, lower IFRs are associated with younger populations (and may also be associated with wealthier populations).

While severe dengue is related to pre-existing non-neutralizing dengue virus (DENV) antibodies, the role of T cells in protection or pathology is unclear. Using cutaneous DENV infection in immunocompetent mice we previously showed the generation of PNA+ germinal centers (GCs), now we assessed the activation and proliferation of B and T cells in draining lymph nodes (DLNs). We found a drastic remodelling of DLN compartments from 7 to 14 days post-infection (dpi) with greatly enlarged B cell follicles, occupying almost half of the DLN area compared to ~24% in naïve conditions. Enormous clusters of proliferating (Ki-67+) cells inside B follicles were found 14 dpi, representing ~33% of B cells in DLNs but only ~2% in non-infected mice. Inside GCs, we noticed an important recruitment of tingle body macrophages removing apoptotic cells. In contrast, the percentage of paracortex area and total T cells decreased by 14–16 dpi, compared to controls. Scattered randomly distributed Ki-67+ T cells were found, similar to non-infected mice. CD69 expression by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was minor, while it was remarkable in B cells, representing 1764.7% of change from basal levels 3 dpi.

During COVID, a new protocol was established with the aim to reduce the burden on inpatient cardiac and imaging resources, where intermediate-risk ACS patents were discharged direct from ED with arrangements made for an expedited outpatient CTCA. Aim: The current study aim was to compare the allocation of hospital resources, completion, and timing of CTCA in the two models of care. Methods: Retrospective cohort study comparing the characteristics and resource allocation of consecutive intermediate-risk ACS patients who went onto undergo CTCA pre- and post-COVID. The decision to investigate with CTCA was made at the discretion of the treating Cardiologist. ED and total inpatient length of stay and the cost in National Weighted Activity Units (NWAU), which is a common unit for measuring hospital activity, were compared. Results: 78 consecutive patients were included (Table). All 39 patients in Group 1 had inpatient CTCA. 36/39 patients attended their arranged CTCA (2 patients failed to attend, 1 patient represented to hospital). Conclusion: An expedited outpatient protocol for investigation of Intermediate-risk ACS was associated with significant reduction in total inpatient length of stay and associated costs, albeit with a significant delay in the time to diagnosis. Further examination into associated patient outcomes is warranted.

RESULTS: Students responded positively to the implementation of TIEP. Most (92%) qualitative feedback students provided in formal evaluations was directly related to at least one principle of TIEP, most commonly ""promoting social, emotional, and academic safety."" Some students (39.3%) interpreted TIEP as demonstrations of ""genuine"" caring for the students as individuals and their own mental health.

Periodontitis, the most prevalent disease that leads to tooth loss, is caused by infection by periodontopathic bacteria. Periodontitis is also a risk factor for pneumonia and the exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, presumably because of the aspiration of saliva contaminated with periodontopathic bacteria into the lower respiratory tract. Patients with these diseases have increased rates of COVID-19 aggravation and mortality. Because periodontopathic bacteria have been isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with COVID-19, periodontitis may be a risk factor for COVID-19 aggravation. However, the molecular links between periodontitis and COVID-19 have not been clarified. In this study, we found that the culture supernatant of the periodontopathic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum (CSF) upregulated the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in A549 alveolar epithelial cells. In addition, CSF induced interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 production by both A549 and primary alveolar epithelial cells. CSF also strongly induced IL-6 and IL-8 expression by BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells and Detroit 562 pharyngeal epithelial cells.

However, it is unknown whether tele-forensic interviewing is an effective alternative to face-to-face interviewing, particularly for children most prone to suggestibility and lapses of attention. HYPOTHESES: Previous studies suggested that school-age children would provide similar amounts of information across interview modes but provided no basis for predicting how misinformation impacts accuracy across modes or how 4- and 5-year-olds would react to tele-forensic interviewing. METHOD: Children (4-8 years, N = 261, Mage = 6.42 years, 48% female) interacted with male assistants who violated a no-touching rule, parents read children a book containing misinformation about that event, and female assistants conducted interviews (usually 2 weeks after the event) face-to-face or via a video conference application. RESULTS: The children were more talkative during a practice narrative phase when interviewed face-to-face rather than on screen (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.26, 95% CI [1.06, 1.51]), and 4-, 5-, and 6-year-olds said more in response to open-ended prompts when interviewed face-to-face (IRR = 1.50, 95% CI [1.08, 2.09]). Children younger than 7 years also disclosed the face touch and noncompleted handshake in response to earlier and less directive prompts when interviewed face-to-face, rs(53) = .28, p = .037, and rs(48) = .33, p = .021, respectively. Children 8 years and older, however, disclosed the face touch more readily when they spoke on screen, rs(28) = -.38, p = .036, and older 7-year-olds and 8-year-olds disclosed the noncompleted handshake more readily on screen, rs(30) = -.36, p = .042. Across interview modes, children reported comparable numbers of touch events, however, and were equally accurate on challenging source-monitoring and detail questions.

The risk of infection for dental teams is assumed to be high, due to work settings, proximity to mouth, exposure to saliva and aerosols. There is a lack of evidence that quantifies the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission for dental patients and staff. Our objective was to assess SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk for dental staff members (DSMs) and patients following exposure in dental clinics during the second wave of the pandemic in Israel. Methods: The study analyzed new positive SARS-CoV-2 cases following exposures in dental clinics from May to September 2020. Two data sources were used: case report forms (CRFs) and epidemiological investigations. CRFs were developed by the MoH and distributed to dental clinics to identify DSMs exposed to SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, and patients exposed to positive DSMs. SARS-CoV-2 status was diagnosed using MoH approved tests in certified laboratories and verified against the National COVID-19 database. Statistical analysis on a non-identified basis was performed. The population incidence rate and dental setting transmission rates were calculated for the study period with 95% Confidence Intervals. Results: From May 1(st) to 30(th) September, SARS-CoV-2 incidence rate in dental clinics was significantly lower when compared to the population. Following 962 reported exposures of DSMs to 508 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, 7 DSMs were SARS – CoV-2 positive with a 0.7% cumulative transmission rate. Following 507 reported exposures by 43 SARS-CoV-2 positive DSMs, 3 patients were SARS – CoV-2 positive, with a 0.6% cumulative transmission rate.

This study explores the influence of genetic and non-genetic factors on INR normalization in the Arab (major part of Near Eastern) population in preprocedural warfarin management. METHODS: An observational prospective cohort study was designed to recruit Arab patients taking warfarin and scheduled for an elective procedure. Two INR readings were recorded. DNA extraction and genotyping of variants in CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3, CYP4F2*3, VKORC1*2, and FII (rs5896) and FVII (rs3093229) genes using real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed. RESULTS: Data from 116 patients were included in the analysis. CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genetic variants carriers required lower maintenance dose compared to non-carriers. The analysis showed that ciprofloxacin, antiplatelet medications, and INR index (INR at visit 1) are the only factors associated with the INR decline rate. Also, the proportion of CYP2C9*3 carriers with normal INR (≤1.2) on the day of surgery was significantly lower than those with wild-type genotype (28% vs 60%, p=0.013). In addition, heparin bridging, INR target, and Sudanese nationality are significant predictors of INR normalization (≤1.2) on the day of the procedure.

Furthermore, more than 80% of fresh water resources are being used for agriculture, and 40% of the total food produced annually, is wasted. One sustainable agricultural practice involves converting by-products from the food and agriculture industry into valuable biomass, such as black soldier flies. Black soldier fly larvae can feed on by-products, and convert them to protein, carbohydrates, and oil. Black soldier flies could be used for feed and food development using different processing methods including enzymatic hydrolysis. ABSTRACT: The effects of chemical protein extraction, and enzymatic hydrolysis with Alcalase, papain and pepsin, on the functional properties, antioxidant activity, amino acid composition and protein structure of black soldier fly (H. illucens) larval protein were examined. Alcalase hydrolysates had the highest degree of hydrolysis (p < 0.05), with the highest hydrolysate and oil fraction yield (p < 0.05). Pepsin hydrolysates showed the lowest oil holding capacity (p < 0.05), whereas no significant differences were observed among other enzymes and protein concentrates (p > 0.05). The emulsifying stability and foam capacity were significantly lower in protein hydrolysates than protein concentrate (p < 0.05). The antioxidant activity of protein hydrolysates from protein concentrate and Alcalase was higher than that with papain and pepsin (p < 0.05), owing to the higher hydrophobic amino acid content.

Non-obstructive general angioscopy can help monitor the aortic intima and detect the locations of abnormal findings, while aortic angioscopy can detect vulnerable plaques in the aorta, which are difficult to visualize using conventional diagnostic methods. Herein, we report the case of a patient with non-anastomotic thoracic aortic graft rupture diagnosed using non-obstructive aortic angioscopy. CASE PRESENTATION: An 85-year-old man who had undergone total arch replacement 5 years prior complained of chest pain. Emergent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed an intra-mediastinal hematoma around the vascular graft of the ascending aorta and angiography revealed pooling of contrast medium on the dorsal side of the vascular graft. We suspected extravasation of the thoracic vascular graft. Aortic angioscopic examination revealed a red vascular graft defect that matched extravasation at the contralateral level of the prosthetic left common carotid artery branch. Subsequently, non-anastomotic thoracic aortic graft rupture was diagnosed. The patient underwent a two-debranching thoracic endovascular aortic repair (Zone 0) with a right subclavian artery-left common carotid artery-left subclavian artery bypass. Postoperative angiography revealed disappearance of the extravasation from the graft rupture site, patent grafted vessels with flow, and no endoleak. Follow-up CT at 6 months postoperatively showed no extravasation.

Robot-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE) has gained popularity due to an easy reproducibility of the open anastomotic technique. In this feasibility study, we described the RAMIE technique introduced in our Center, providing innovative details for a mechanical end-to-end anastomosis. With patient in prone position, esophagectomy is conducted through the meso-esophagus plan. Robotic hand-sewn purse-string is realized above Azygos vein. A 4-cm thoracotomy in the fifth intercostal space is performed by enlarging the trocar incision. The tubulization is performed to create an access pouch for the introduction of the circular stapler. After the creation of the end-to-end anastomosis, the access pouch is resected and a robotic over-sewn is realized. From January 2020 until July 2020, ten patients were enrolled. No restriction in term of age, BMI, ASA grade or previous surgery were applied. Median operative time was 700 min. R0 resection was achieved in all cases with a good lymph node harvesting. No anastomotic leak or stricture were observed. One chyle leak was treated conservatively. Median length of stay was 8 days and 90 days mortality was 0%. This study evidenced how robotic surgery allowed us to perform the same anastomosis of our open technique with good oncological results and morbidity and length of stay comparable with our previous results.

MERS CoV is characterized by its high mortality rate among different human coronaviruses. MERS CoV polymerase shares more than 20% sequence identity with the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Non-structural 5b (NS5b) RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Despite the low sequence identity, the active site is conserved between the two proteins, with two consecutive aspartates that are crucial in the nucleotide transfer reaction. In this study, seven nucleotide inhibitors have been tested against MERS CoV RdRp using molecular modeling and docking simulations, from which four are novel compounds. Molecular Dynamics Simulation for 260 nanoseconds is performed on the MERS CoV RdRp model to test the effect of protein dynamics on the binding affinities to the tested nucleotide inhibitors. Results support the hypothesis of using the anti-polymerases (Anti-HCV drugs) against MERS CoV RdRp as a potent candidates.

It is receiving increasing attention from the scientific community because of its concerted and harmonized approach, which promotes employment access, return, and healthy long-term continuation. Although promising, integrated prevention is not yet well-defined, which makes it difficult to operationalize. OBJECTIVE: This manuscript exposes the protocol of a study aiming to conceptualize integrated prevention at work on the basis of scientific and experiential knowledge. METHODS: Using a concept analysis research design, data collection has been planned in 2 parts. A meta-narrative literature review will first be conducted to document how integrated prevention has been defined in the literature. Then, phone interviews will be conducted with key informers (ie, managers, workers, ergonomists, occupational therapists, psychologists, physiotherapists, union and insurance representatives) to document their viewpoints and understanding of integrated prevention at work. Qualitative data gathered during these 2 parts of research will be analyzed using template analysis, which allows data from literature and empirical collection to be analyzed simultaneously. The analysis will bring out the points of convergence, divergence, and complementarity between the information gleaned from literature and key informers’ experiences to arrive at a conceptualization of integrated prevention at work by identifying its uses, attributes, antecedents, and consequences. As a final step, validation and interpretation with a TRIAGE (Technique for Research of Information by Animation of a Group of Experts) group will be carried out in collaboration with the key informers to identify the tools for the implementation of integrated prevention at work and promote workers’ health and safety. RESULTS: This study is expected to offer a contemporary conceptualization of integrated prevention at work that clearly lays out the variables of this concept and elicits the viewpoints of the different stakeholders. CONCLUSIONS: This study will contribute to the advancement of knowledge about the professional injury prevention continuum. The clear identification of the uses, attributes, antecedents, and consequences of integrated prevention at work will offer concrete tools to stakeholders to implement innovative and promising approaches to integrated prevention at work.

Materials and Methods: The MIRI model in rats was firstly constructed. Twenty-four male rats were randomly assigned into the sham group, ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) group, and simvastatin group, with 8 rats in each group. Contents of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as serum levels of CK and inflammatory factors, in rats were determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the three groups was examined. Through flow cytometry and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, apoptosis and viability in each group were detected, respectively. Relative levels of HMGB1, Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), eNOS, and thrombomodulin (TM) were finally determined. Results: Simvastatin treatment markedly enhanced SOD activity and reduced contents of MDA, LDH, and creatine kinase (CK) in MIRI rats. The increased apoptosis and decreased viability following MIRI were partially reversed by simvastatin treatment. Besides, MIRI resulted in the upregulation of inflammatory factors and chemokines. Their elevations were abolished by simvastatin. In MIRI rats, simvastatin upregulated KLF2 and p-eNOS.

Unadjusted analysis showed that patients having undergone major surgery within the past 3 months had an increased risk of COVID-19 while we did not find increased Odds Ratio (OR) related to other oncological treatment modalities. No patients treated with stem cell or bone marrow transplant were diagnosed with COVID-19. The fatality rate of COVID-19 among cancer patients was 0.10. This was similar to non-cancer patients, when adjusting for age and sex with OR (95% CI) for death= 0.99 (0.68–1.42). Patients with distant metastases had significantly increased OR of death due to COVID-19 disease of 9.31 (95% CI 2.60–33.34). For the combined outcome death and/or admittance to hospital due to COVID-19, we found significant two-fold increased risk estimates for patients diagnosed with cancer less than one 1 year ago (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.14–3.80), for those treated with anti-cancer drugs during the past 3 months (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.07–3.01) and for patients undergoing major surgery during the past 3 months (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.40–3.44).",2021-03-25,"Johannesen, Tom Børge; Smeland, Sigbjørn; Aaserud, Stein; Buanes, Eirik Alnes; Skog, Anna; Ursin, Giske; Helland, Åslaug",Front Oncol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/142113b16e28546c4449257adff76f492f9c1276.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8027113.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.652535; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33842366/,232342115.0

Remdesivir and Tocilizumab for the Treatment of Severe COVID-19 in a Community Hospital: A Retrospective Cohort Study,10.1093/ofid/ofab466.750,PMC8644042,,cc-by,"BACKGROUND: Growing evidence supports the use of remdesivir and tocilizumab for the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of remdesivir and tocilizumab for the treatment of severe COVID-19 in a community hospital setting. METHODS: We used a de-identified dataset of hospitalized adults with severe COVID-19 according to the National Institutes of Health definition (SpO2 < 94% on room air, a PaO2/FiO2 < 300 mm Hg, respiratory frequency > 30/min, or lung infiltrates > 50%) admitted to our community hospital located in Evanston Illinois, between March 1, 2020, and March 1, 2021. We performed a Cox proportional hazards regression model to examine the relationship between the use of remdesivir and tocilizumab and inpatient mortality. To minimize confounders, we adjusted for age, qSOFA score, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, and steroids, forcing these variables into the model. We implemented a sensitivity analysis calculating the E-value (with the lower confidence limit) for the obtained point estimates to assess the potential effect of unmeasured confounding. Figure 1. Kaplan–Meier survival curves for in-hospital death among patients treated with and without steroids [Image: see text] The hazard ratio was derived from a bivariable Cox regression model. The survival curves were compared with a log-rank test, where a two-sided P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Figure 2. Kaplan–Meier survival curves for in-hospital death among patients treated with and without remdesivir [Image: see text] The hazard ratio was derived from a bivariable Cox regression model. The survival curves were compared with a log-rank test, where a two-sided P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 549 patients were included. The median age was 69 years (interquartile range, 59 – 80 years), 333 (59.6%) were male, 231 were White (41.3%), and 235 (42%) were admitted from long-term care facilities. 394 (70.5%) received steroids, 192 (34.3%) received remdesivir, and 49 (8.8%) received tocilizumab. By the cutoff date for data analysis, 389 (69.6%) patients survived, and 170 (30.4%) had died. The bivariable Cox regression models showed decreased hazard of in-hospital death associated with the administration of steroids (Figure 1), remdesivir (Figure 2), and tocilizumab (Figure 3). This association persisted in the multivariable Cox regression controlling for other predictors (Figure 4). The E value for the multivariable Cox regression point estimates and the lower confidence intervals are shown in Table 1. Figure 3. Kaplan–Meier survival curves for in-hospital death among patients treated with and without tocilizumab [Image: see text] The hazard ratio was derived from a bivariable Cox regression model. The survival curves were compared with a log-rank test, where a two-sided P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Figure 4.

Table 1. Sensitivity analysis of unmeasured confounding using E-values [Image: see text] CI, confidence interval. Point estimate from multivariable Cox regression model. The E value is defined as the minimum strength of association on the risk ratio scale that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the exposure and the outcome, conditional on the measured covariates, to explain away a specific exposure-outcome association fully: i.e., a confounder not included in the multivariable Cox regression model associated with remdesivir or tocilizumab use and in-hospital death in patients with severe COVID-19 by a hazard ratio of 1.64-fold or 1.54-fold each, respectively, could explain away the lower confidence limit, but weaker confounding could not. CONCLUSION: For patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to our community hospital, the use of steroids, remdesivir, and tocilizumab were significantly associated with a slower progression to in-hospital death while controlling for other predictors included in the models.

OBJECTIVE: Using multidimensional assessments of child maltreatment (CM; threat vs. deprivation), the present study examined whether parent-report and child-report of Covid-19 related stress potentiated the effect of CM on sleep problems among boys and girls. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The study focused on a sample of 124 dyads of adolescents (Mage = 12.89, SD = 0.79; 52% female) and their primary caregivers (93% mothers) assessed before and during the pandemic (May to October 2020). METHOD: Data were obtained from both youth and their parents. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test all study hypotheses. Simple slopes and Johnson-Neyman plots were generated to probe significant interaction effects. RESULTS: Deprivation, but not threat, directly predicted increased sleep problems among boys during the pandemic.

METHODS: At our Emergency Department of the Crema Hospital, from the beginning of the pandemic until the end of June 2020, 54 consecutive patients admitted to ICU suffering from severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and severe respiratory distress (ARDS) attributable to viral SARS - CoV - 2 infection were recruited. The recruitment criterion was based on refractory hypoxia, general condition and clinical impairment, comorbidities and CT images. The incoming parameters of the blood chemistry and radiology investigations and the timing of the gold - tracheal intubation were compared. Medical therapy was based on the application of shared protocols. RESULTS: The onset of symptoms was varyng, i.e. within the range of 1–14 days. The average time from the admission to the emergency room to the admission to intensive care was approximately 120 h. The average number of days of hospitalization in the ICU was 28 days. With a majority of male patients, the most significant age group was between 60 and 69 years. There were 21 deaths and, compared to the survivors, the deceased ones were older at an average age of about 67 years (vs an average age of the survivors of about 59 years). From the available data entering the ICU, the surviving patients presented average better values of oximetry and blood gas analysis, with a lower average dosage of D-Dimer than the deceased. Ones with a presence of bilateral pneumonia in all patients, the worsening of the ARDS occurred in 31 patients. 9 out of 25 patients early intubated died, while 12 out of 23 patients died when intubation was performed after 24 h of non-invasive ventilation. The presence of multiple comorbidities was shown in 17 of 28 patients and revealed an additional adverse prognostic factor. Also, more than one complication in the same patient were detected; after respiratory worsening, renal failure was more frequently found in 16 patients. Some particular complications such as lesions induced by ventilation with barotrauma mechanism (VILI), ischemic heart disease and the appearance of central and peripheral neurological events were detected too. CONSIDERATIONS: SARS - CoV - 2 disease is caused by a new coronavirus that has its main route of transmission through respiratory droplets and close contact, resulting in a sudden onset of the clinical syndrome with acute respiratory infection (SARI) and severe respiratory distress (ARDS). But it can also appear with other symptoms such as gastrointestinal or neurological events, as to be considered as a disease with multisystem phenotype. This pathology evolves towards a serious form of systemic disease from an acute lung damage to venous and arterial thromboembolic complications and multi-organ failure, mostly associated with high mortality. All patients received empirical or targeted antibiotic therapy for prevention and control of infections of potential pathogens, together with low molecular weight heparin therapy. The majority of patients was subjected to the off - label protocol with antivirals and hydroxychloroquine therapy, we used cortisone support therapy under surveillance and in 3 cases the protocol with anti - IL6 monoclonal antibody (Tolicizumab). In a simplified classification of the tomographic examination of the chest, mostly 3D and 2C lesions were found in the deceased patients with a prevalence of severe and moderate forms, whilst in the survivors the distribution appears with a prevalence of medium and moderate forms. Among the intubated patients, 21 patients, all suffering from worsening ARDS, died whilst there was no mortality in patients subjected to non-invasive ventilation it so. The heterogeneity of the respiratory syndromes and the presence of multiple comorbidities represent an unfortunate prognostic factor. Among the complications, besides the respiratory worsening, renal failure, liver failure and the state of sepsis were most frequently found; less frequent complications were lesions induced by ventilation with a barotrauma mechanism, ischemic heart disease, the appearance of central neurological events of sensory alterations, meningo - encephalitis and cerebral hemorrhage, and peripheral neurological events with polyneuro - myopathies. Mechanical ventilation can adversely affect the prognosis due to lung damage induced, protective ventilation remains the necessary treatment during severe hypoxia in patients with SARS - CoV - 2. The essential prerequisite remains the search for optimal ‘customized’ values since conditions can vary from patient to patient and, in the same patient, during different times of ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: In these extraordinary circumstances, our reality was among the most affected and was able to hold the impact thanks to the immediate great response set in place by the operators, although it costed us an effort especially the one to try to guarantee a high quality level of assistance and care compared to the huge wave of patients in seriously bad conditions. Further research on this heterogeneous pathology and data sharing could help identify a more dedicated clinical decision-making and treatment pathway that, together with a resource planning, would allow us to better face any new disease outbreak.",2020-08-16,"Comassi, Paolo; Zuccon, William; Adriani, Luca; Bergamaschini, Giulio; Bertin, Elena; Borromeo, Raffaella; Corti, Serena; De Petri, Federica; Dolci, Francesco; Galmozzi, Attilio; Gigliotti, Alberto; Gualdoni, Livio; Guerra, Claudia; Khosthiova, Anna; Leati, Giovanni; Lupi, Giuseppe; Moscato, Paolo; Perotti, Vittorio; Piantelli, Miriam; Ruini, Alain; Sportelli, Silvia; Susca, Micaela; Troiano, Carmine; Benelli, Giampaolo; Buscarini, Elisabetta; Canetta, Ciro; Merli, Guido; Scartabellati, Alessandro; Giovanni Melilli, B.S.C.; Sfogliarini, Roberto; Pellegatta, Germano; Viganò, Giovanni",Am J Emerg Med,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/0cc89e740fadba4e6a4a125d6e0d131521402526.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7428689.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.08.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675720306884?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33046317/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675720306884,221136191.0

This has led to a transition to telemedicine and directly impacts patient volume, evaluation and management practices. The objective of this study is to determine the impact of COVID-19 on patient characteristics in relation to outpatient attendance, ancillary testing, medical therapy, and surgical decision making. METHODS: A retrospective case series at an academic medical center was performed. Outpatient appointments from October 2019 (pre-COVID) and March 16–April 10, 2020 (COVID) were analyzed. Prevalence rates and odds ratios were used to compare demographics, visit characteristics, ancillary tests, medication prescribing, and surgical decisions between telemedicine and in-person visits, before and during COVID. RESULTS: There was a decrease in scheduled visits during the COVID timeframe, for both in-person and telemedicine visits, with a comparable proportion of no-shows. There was a higher overall percentage of Hispanic/Latino patients who received care during the COVID timeframe (OR = 1.43; 95% CI = 1.07–1.90) in both groups, although primary language was not significantly associated with attendance. There were fewer ancillary tests ordered (OR = 0.54) and more medications prescribed (OR = 1.59) during COVID telemedicine visits compared with pre-COVID in-person visits. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has rapidly changed the use of telemedicine. Telemedicine can be used as a tool to reach patients with severe disease burden. Continued healthcare reform, expanded access to affordable care, and efficient use of resources is essential both during the current COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

Different studies have focused on potential psychological distress resulting from the rupture of consolidated habits and routines related to the lockdown measures. Nevertheless, the subjective experience of individuals and the variations in the way of interpreting the lockdown measures remain substantially unexplored. Within the frame of Semiotic Cultural Psychosocial Theory, the study pursued two main goals: first, to explore the symbolic universes (SUs) through which Italian people represented the pandemic crisis and its meaning in their life; and second, to examine how the interpretation of the crisis varies over societal segments with different sociodemographic characteristics and specific life challenges. An online survey was available during the Italian lockdown. Respondents were asked to write a passage about the meaning of living in the time of COVID-19. A total of 1,393 questionnaires (mean = 35.47; standard deviation = 14.92; women: 64.8%; North Italy: 33%; Center Italy: 27%; South Italy: 40%) were collected. The Automated Method for Content Analysis procedure was applied to the collected texts to detect the factorial dimensions underpinning (dis)similarities in the respondents’ discourses. Such factors were interpreted as the markers of latent dimensions of meanings defining the SUs active in the sample. A set of χ(2) analysis allowed exploring the association between SUs and respondents’ characteristics. Four SUs were identified, labeled “Reconsider social priorities,” “Reconsider personal priorities,” “Live with emergency,” and “Surviving a war,” characterized by the pertinentization of two extremely basic issues: what the pandemic consists of (health emergency versus turning point) and its extent and impact (daily life vs. world scenario). Significant associations were found between SUs and all the respondents’ characteristics considered (sex, age, job status, job situation during lockdown, and place of living). The findings will be discussed in light of the role of the media and institutional scenario and psychosocial conditions in mediating the representation of the pandemic and in favoring or constraining the availability of symbolic resources underpinning people’s capability to address the crisis.",2020-09-17,"Venuleo, Claudia; Marinaci, Tiziana; Gennaro, Alessandro; Palmieri, Arianna",Front Psychol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/d7efeac517b07544c91ef795abce33b8a99dba58.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7527434.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33041950/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.577077,221742641.0

However, there is compelling evidence for a fast-paced waning of immunity. The increasing number of new variants that could alter the severity, transmissibility, and potential to evade the immune response raised significant concern. Therefore, elucidating changes in the humoral immune response against viral variants induced by vaccines over time is crucial for improving immunization protocols. We carried out a 6-month longitudinal prospective study in which 60 individuals between 21 and 71 years of age who have received the complete scheme of the BNT162b2 vaccine were followed to determine titers of serum neutralizing activity. The neutralizing capacity was measured at one, three, and six-months post-vaccination by plaque reduction neutralization assay using SARS-CoV-2 B.1 (D614G) and the Gamma, Alpha, Delta, and Mu variants. Data were analyzed using GraphPad 5.0. Neutralizing activity against five different SARS-CoV-2 variants was detected in the serum samples of all vaccinated participants to a different extent after one month, with a progressive decrease according to age and gender. Overall, after one month of vaccination, the neutralizing titer was lower for all evaluated variants when compared to B.1, most remarkable against Delta and Mu, with a reduction of 83.1% and 92.3%, respectively. In addition, the Titer at 3- or 6-months follow-up decreased dramatically for all variants. Our results support the decaying of serum neutralizing activity, both over time and across SARS-CoV-2 variants, being more significant in older men. Since Delta and Mu appear to evade the neutralizing activity, these and further new variants of immune escape mutations should be considered for novel vaccine formulations.",2022-05-02,"Lopera, Tulio J.; Chvatal-Medina, Mateo; Flórez-Álvarez, Lizdany; Zapata-Cardona, Maria I.; Taborda, Natalia A.; Rugeles, Maria T.; Hernandez, Juan C.",Front Immunol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/2ebc242e3a4a72b48da9409b4005207c38834c1d.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC9108166.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35585980/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.879036,248479048.0

Therefore, it is necessary to examine the state of the infrastructure and the quality of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services in rural hospitals. METHODS: The study was descriptive and included an analysis and assessment of the current situation on the ground. The analysis of the situation was based on the official data. The current services were assessed using an observational cross-sectional study based at the hospital of Abay district (49°37′52″ N 72°50′17″ E, 6725 km2) of Central Kazakhstan. RESULTS: The hospital in Abay district do not have a set of agreed WASH standards. When such standards exist, their implementation is limited by the lack of necessary conditions, sufficient funding or the interest of authorities. The budget of public health service is usually categorized by a disease group and covers expenditures for drugs and vaccines. The quality of WASH infrastructure in the hospital is poor due to deterioration or initial non-compliance with safety requirements. Investing in WASH infrastructure and its maintaining require effective intersectoral collaboration and financial resources. Another problem is the lack of motivation for improving WASH services among staff and managers of the hospital. If the former have no desire and knowledge in WASH due to their high workload, the latter often consider this problem insoluble and therefore do not want to spend their limited resources on it. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, rural residents are at high risk of contracting and spreading COVID-19 due to deterioration of WASH infrastructure, non-compliance with requirements and insufficient funding of rural hospitals. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: This research is funded by the Science Committee of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan (Grant No. AP09058465). KEY MESSAGES: The lack of data on WASH services in hospitals by region and on a nationwide scale is currently an obstacle to an effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Kazakhstan.

Background: Neurotologic microsurgery requires work at the limits of human visual and tactile capabilities. Anatomy localization comes at the expense of invasiveness caused by exposing structures and using them as orientation landmarks. In the absence of more-precise and less-invasive anatomy localization alternatives, surgery poses considerable risks of iatrogenic injury and sub-optimal treatment. There exists an unmet clinical need for an accurate, precise, and minimally-invasive means for anatomy localization and instrument navigation during neurotologic surgery. Freehand stereotactic image-guidance constitutes a solution to this. While the technology is routinely used in medical fields such as neurosurgery and rhinology, to date, it is not used for neurotologic surgery due to insufficient accuracy of clinically available systems. Materials and Methods: A freehand stereotactic image-guidance system tailored to the needs of neurotologic surgery–most importantly sub-half-millimeter accuracy–was developed. Its TRE was assessed preclinically using a task-specific phantom. A pilot clinical trial targeting N = 20 study participants was conducted (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03852329) to validate the accuracy and usefulness of the developed system. Clinically, objective assessment of the TRE is impossible because establishing a sufficiently accurate ground-truth is impossible. A method was used to validate accuracy and usefulness based on intersubjectivity assessment of surgeon ratings of corresponding image-pairs from the microscope/endoscope and the image-guidance system. Results: During the preclinical accuracy assessment the TRE was measured as 0.120 ± 0.05 mm (max: 0.27 mm, μ(TRE) + 3σ(TRE) = 0.27 mm, N = 310). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the study was terminated early after N = 3 participants. During an endoscopic cholesteatoma removal, a microscopic facial nerve schwannoma removal, and a microscopic revision cochlear implantation, N = 75 accuracy and usefulness ratings were collected from five surgeons each grading 15 image-pairs. On a scale from 1 (worst rating) to 5 (best rating), the median (interquartile range) accuracy and usefulness ratings were assessed as 5 (4–5) and 4 (4–5) respectively. Conclusion: Navigating surgery in the tympanomastoid compartment and potentially in the lateral skull base with sufficiently accurate freehand stereotactic image-guidance (μ(TRE) + 3σ(TRE) < 0.5 mm) is feasible, safe, and useful.

Most patients with severe COVID-19 infections who died had developed ARDS. Currently, ARDS is treated with supportive measures, but regenerative medicine approaches including extracellular vesicle (EV)-based therapies have shown promise. Herein, we aimed to analyse whether EV-based therapies could be effective in treating severe pulmonary conditions that affect COVID-19 patients and to understand their relevance for an eventual therapeutic application to human patients. Using a defined search strategy, we conducted a systematic review of the literature and found 39 articles (2014–2020) that reported effects of EVs, mainly derived from stem cells, in lung injury models (one large animal study, none in human). EV treatment resulted in: (1) attenuation of inflammation (reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil infiltration, M2 macrophage polarization); (2) regeneration of alveolar epithelium (decreased apoptosis and stimulation of surfactant production); (3) repair of microvascular permeability (increased endothelial cell junction proteins); (4) prevention of fibrosis (reduced fibrin production). These effects were mediated by the release of EV cargo and identified factors including miRs-126, −30b-3p, −145, −27a-3p, syndecan-1, hepatocyte growth factor and angiopoietin-1. This review indicates that EV-based therapies hold great potential for COVID-19 related lung injuries as they target multiple pathways and enhance tissue regeneration. However, before translating EV therapies into human clinical trials, efforts should be directed at developing good manufacturing practice solutions for EVs and testing optimal dosage and administration route in large animal models.",2020-08-06,"Khalaj, Kasra; Figueira, Rebeca Lopes; Antounians, Lina; Lauriti, Giuseppe; Zani, Augusto",Journal of extracellular vesicles,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/3cc0fb28e85ab10da56e3b8e165f3d70ff0658f1.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7481829.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32944185/; https://doi.org/10.1080/20013078.2020.1795365,221740289.0

For instance, with SARS-CoV-2, masking can influence host-to-host transmission, while stay-at-home orders can influence mobility. Importantly, transmission rates and mobility patterns can influence pathogen-induced hospitalization rates. This poses a significant challenge for the use of mathematical models of disease dynamics in forecasting the spread of a pathogen; to create accurate forecasts in spatial models of disease spread, we must simultaneously account for time-varying rates of transmission and host movement. In this study, we develop a statistical model-fitting algorithm to estimate dynamic rates of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and host movement from geo-referenced hospitalization data. Using simulated data sets, we then test whether our method can accurately estimate these time-varying rates simultaneously, and how this accuracy is influenced by the spatial population structure. Our model-fitting method relies on a highly parallelized process of grid search and a sliding window technique that allows us to estimate time-varying transmission rates with high accuracy and precision, as well as movement rates with somewhat lower precision. Estimated parameters also had lower precision in more rural data sets, due to lower hospitalization rates (i.e., these areas are less data-rich). This model-fitting routine could easily be generalized to any stochastic, spatially-explicit modeling framework, offering a flexible and efficient method to estimate time-varying parameters from geo-referenced data sets.",2022-03-22,"Ratnavale, S.; Hepp, C.

The disagreement results, in part, from the interpretation of studies that report a proportion of asymptomatic people with SARS-CoV-2 detected at a single point. Review questions: 1. Amongst people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2, what proportion does not experience symptoms at all during their infection? 2. Amongst people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are asymptomatic when diagnosed, what proportion will develop symptoms later? 3. What proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is accounted for by people who are either asymptomatic throughout infection, or pre-symptomatic? Methods: Rapid living systematic review (protocol https://osf.io/9ewys/). We searched Pubmed, Embase, bioRxiv and medRxiv using a living evidence database of SARS-CoV-2 literature on 25.03.2020. We included studies of people with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) that documented follow-up and symptom status at the beginning and end of follow-up and modelling studies. Study selection, data extraction and bias assessment were done by one reviewer and verified by a second, with disagreement resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. We used a common-effect model to synthesise proportions from comparable studies. Results: We screened 89 studies and included 11. We estimated an upper bound for the proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections of 29% (95% confidence interval 23 to 37%) in eight studies. Selection bias and likely publication bias affected the family case investigation studies. One statistical modelling study estimated the true proportion of asymptomatic infections at 18% (95% credibility interval 16 to 20%). Estimates of the proportions of pre-symptomatic individual in four studies were too heterogeneous to combine. In modelling studies, 40-60% of all SARS-CoV-2 infections are the result of transmission from pre-symptomatic individuals, with a smaller contribution from asymptomatic individuals. Conclusions: An intermediate contribution of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infections to overall SARS-CoV-2 transmission means that combination prevention, with enhanced hand and respiratory hygiene, testing tracing and isolation strategies and social distancing, will continue to be needed. The findings of this systematic review of publications early in the pandemic suggests that most SARS-CoV-2 infections are not asymptomatic throughout the course of infection.",2020-04-29,"Buitrago-Garcia, D.

Here, we report on multi-model forecasts of Covid-19 in the UK that were generated at regular intervals starting at the end of March 2020, in order to monitor expected healthcare utilisation and population impacts in real time. Methods: We evaluated the performance of individual model forecasts generated between 24 March and 14 July 2020, using a variety of metrics including the weighted interval score as well as metrics that assess the calibration, sharpness, bias and absolute error of forecasts separately. We further combined the predictions from individual models to ensemble forecasts using a simple mean as well as a quantile regression average that aimed to maximise performance. We further compared model performance to a null model of no change. Results: In most cases, individual models performed better than the null model, and ensembles models were well calibrated and performed comparatively to the best individual models. The quantile regression average did not noticeably outperform the mean ensemble.

The former is considered as source information and the latter destination information. An information coefficient is calculated as a measure for fidelity of this information transfer process and thus a measure of similarity between primer and potential annealing site on template.

This study aimed to investigate the variations and drivers of multiple mortality causes. DESIGN: This was a retrospective cross-sectional surveillance study. SETTING: Original data in 1991 and 2000, and secondary data in 2010 and 2019 were collected from DSPs across China. PARTICIPANTS: Standardised mortality rates (SMRs) and crude mortality rates (CMRs) of the Chinese population in 1991, 2000, 2010 and 2019 were ascertained. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in the Gini coefficients (G), computed using SMR, were decomposed into reranking (R) and proportionality (P) to identify variations in communicable, maternal, neonatal and nutritional diseases (CMNN); non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and injury. The CMR difference (in %) was partitioned into the demographic structure and non-demographic factors using the mortality-rate-difference method. RESULTS: From 1991 to 2019, the overall CMR increased from 591.327/100 000 to 674.505/100 000, whereas the SMR continually decreased. An increasing concentration of NCDs contributed to the increased all-cause G from 0.443 to 0.560 during 1991–2019. Between 1991 and 2019, compared with CMNN (R=0.054) and NCDs (R=0.037), the ranking of injury changed the most (R=0.174). The ranking of diabetes, falls and road traffic accidents increased markedly over time. The decreased SMR of NCDs (P=−0.013) was mainly due to low-ranking causes, whereas changes in CMNN (P=0.003) and injury (P=0.131) were due to high-ranking causes. All-cause CMR increased by 14.06% from 1991 to 2019 due to greater contributions from the demographic structure (68.46%) than the non-demographic factors (−54.40%). Demographic structural changes accounted more for CMR increases in males (70.52%) and urban populations (75.58%).

These technologies are capable of providing huge bandwidth and transmitting the data at very high speed with low energy consumption. FSO is a very convenient technology to quickly expand the legacy network in the adverse geographical areas. However, its link performance is highly dependent of inconsistent weather conditions. SMF based fiber optic link has a very low loss and its performance is almost independent on the weather conditions. Though, the installation and maintenance of fibers are quite complex and costly. Individually, FSO or SMF links have their limitations and have to be integrated to leverage their benefits. In this paper, we integrated FSO/SMF links and compared the performance of the proposed architecture which is capable of providing high-speed dual-rate data transmission. The proposed architecture transmits data over either FSO or SMF or both links simultaneously and has 100% more reliability against any one of the link failures. In case of operational link failure (FSO/SMF), data may be switched to the alternative working link (SMF/FSO), simply by tuning the transmitted signal by 50 GHz. The proposed architecture is also reliable against the optical line terminal transceiver (TRx) failure as each user located in the network can be served by two transceivers (1 Gbps and 10 Gbps). The proposed architecture also supports the wavelength division multiplexing overlay transmission for broadcasting the common signal to all the available users in the networks. The architecture reduces ~ 27% of the energy consumption by utilizing the appropriate link of hybrid architecture and TRx according to weather conditions and traffic load. The integrated architecture looks attractive for providing energy-efficient, high speed, and reliable internet coverage to the areas where there is a difficulty of laying fibers and has frequent fiber faults. The architecture is useful for strengthening and boosting rural and urban development.",2021-10-13,"Garg, Amit Kumar; Metya, Sanjeev Kumar; Singh, Ghanshyam; Janyani, Vijay; Aly, Moustafa H.; Zainol Abidin, N.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Insulin resistance was induced in rats with a fructose-rich diet and confirmed from baseline analysis of FBS (>250 mg/dl), insulin (>25 µIU/ml), and HOMA-IR (>10). For 12 weeks, the insulin-resistant rats were treated exclusively with 5000 mg/kg b.w avicularin (DAvi) or by dietary placement on lettuce (DLet) or a combination of both and compared with non-insulin resistant rats. RESULTS: Avicularin reversed alterations in HbA1c and insulin levels. DLet produced no significant effect on the incretins GLP 1 (P=0.909) and GIP (P=0.990), but DAvi slightly stimulated GLP 1 but not GIP. A strong positive correlation was found between improved β-cell responsiveness and the insulin signaling molecules: Akt2 (r=0.7248), IRS 1 (r=0.5173), and PI3K (r=0.7892). Only the combined avicularin and lettuce reversed the Akt2 levels (P=0.728). The lettuce meal slightly stimulated PI3K but normalized IRS 1 while avicularin treatment slightly stimulated IRS 1 but restored the PI3K levels (P=0.815). The positive correlation between β-cell responsiveness and hexokinase (r=0.5959), PFK (r=0.6222), and PK (r=0.6591) activities were statistically significant.

Here, we formulate agent-based models that simulate the spread of a respiratory infectious disease in a train wagon in the Manila Light Rail Transit System, and in a 49-seater public utility bus. We consider preventive measures such as implementation of social distancing, and limitation of interaction or movement among the commuters to investigate how these measures will inhibit disease transmission. We also consider the effect of protective gears and practices, crowd density, and prevalence of disease in the community on the possible number of newly-infected individuals. Our simulations show that (i) individuals must have protection with more than 90% effectiveness to inhibit transmission of the disease; (ii) social or physical distancing by more than 1m distance reduces the risk of being infected; (iii) minimizing movement or interaction with other passengers reduces the risk of transmission by 50%; (iv) passenger capacity should be less than 10-50% of the maximum seating capacity to reduce the number of infections depending on the level of imposed social distancing and passenger interaction; (v) vehicles with greater number of occupied seating capacity generate higher number of infections but vehicles with smaller dimensions have faster disease transmissions; and (vi) ideal set-up for a 24-seater train wagon (49-seater bus) is to allow a maximum of 12 (24) passengers, with little to no interaction among passengers, with social distancing of more than 1m distance apart, and each person has a protection with 90% effectiveness as much as possible.

Safe and effective therapies are urgently needed. METHODS: Therapeutics for Inpatients with COVID-19 (TICO), is a global multi-arm, multi-stage (MAMS) platform master protocol, which facilitates the rapid evaluation of the safety and efficacy of candidate anti-viral therapeutic agents for adults hospitalized with COVID-19. The protocol design allows multiple therapeutic agents to be evaluated in an efficient and scientifically rigorous manner, with efficiencies delivered by the MAMS design, and began by studying neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. TICO employs an agile and robust approach to futility and safety evaluation at 300 patients enrolled (Stage 1), with subsequent expansion to full sample size and an expanded target population (Stage 2) if the agent shows an acceptable safety profile and evidence of efficacy. Two ordinal outcomes applied early (Day 5) determine the efficacy signals of the investigational agents(s) and progression to Stage 2. These ordinal outcomes assess both respiratory and other organ failure events, recognizing the broad range of COVID-19 morbidity. In Stage 2, overall efficacy is assessed using the primary outcome of ‘time to sustained recovery’ assessed over 90 days. This approach to early futility assessment using an early intermediate outcome and a primary endpoint out to 90 days allows the study team to make rapid decisions on safety and potential efficacy of novel agents while ultimately focusing on patient-centered, longer-term outcomes. The implementation of TICO across a global network allows for continued enrollment despite variations in geographic epidemiology. STUDY STATUS: The TICO master protocol moved from conception to first patient enrolled in approximately 9 weeks, a testament to the expedited regulatory and ethics review, coupled with flexible and responsive study operations. The first agent to be tested using this protocol, LY-CoV-555, enrolled N=326 participants before undergoing Stage 1 futility and safety assessment. Two additional agents will enter the study in November 2020, with other agents planned. CONCLUSION: The TICO MAMS platform trial has been implemented efficiently across a global network of sites and several trial networks. It will generate results rapidly for multiple novel neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and other therapeutics agents.",2020-11-12,"Murray, Daniel D.; Babiker, Abdel G.; Baker, Jason V.; Barkauskas, Christina E.; Brown, Samuel M.; Chang, Christina; Davey, Victoria J.; Gelijns, Annetine C.; Ginde, Adit A.; Grund, Birgit; Higgs, Elizabeth; Hudson, Fleur; Kan, Virginia L.; Lane, H.

Ecosystem disturbances and decreased host species richness have been associated with the emergence of zoonotic diseases. In this study, we aimed at (a) characterizing the viral diversity in seven neotropical rodent species living in four types of habitats and (b) exploring how the extent of environmental disturbance influences this diversity. Through a metagenomic approach, we identified 77,767 viral sequences from spleen, kidney, and serum samples. These viral sequences were attributed to 27 viral families known to infect vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and amoeba. Viral diversities were greater in pristine habitats compared with disturbed ones, and lowest in peri-urban areas. High viral richness was observed in savannah areas. Differences in these diversities were explained by rare viruses that were generally more frequent in pristine forest and savannah habitats. Moreover, changes in the ecology and behavior of rodent hosts, in a given habitat, such as modifications to the diet in disturbed vs. pristine forests, are major determinants of viral composition. Lastly, the phylogenetic relationships of four vertebrate-related viral families (Polyomaviridae, Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, and Phenuiviridae) highlighted the wide diversity of these viral families, and in some cases, a potential risk of transmission to humans. All these findings provide significant insights into the diversity of rodent viruses in Amazonia, and emphasize that habitats and the host’s dietary ecology may drive viral diversity. Linking viral richness and abundance to the ecology of their hosts and their responses to habitat disturbance could be the starting point for a better understanding of viral emergence and for future management of ecosystems.",2021-08-26,"Tirera, Sourakhata; de Thoisy, Benoit; Donato, Damien; Bouchier, Christiane; Lacoste, Vincent; Franc, Alain; Lavergne, Anne",Viruses,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/4e8e95e612c3d626320411246eaf2f3310202824.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8472065.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13091690; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34578272/,238199263.0

HAT is based on hemagglutination, triggered by a single reagent (IH4-RBD) comprised of the viral RBD domain fused to a nanobody specific for glycophorin, which is expressed at very high levels at the surface of human red blood cells (RBCs). One of the main initial goals of this study was to devise a test protocol that would be sensitive and reliable, yet require no specialized laboratory equipment such as adjustable pipets, so that it could be performed in the most remote corners of the world by people with minimal levels of training. Because antibody levels against the viral RBD have been found to correlate closely with sero-neutralisation titers, and thus with protection against reinfection, it has become obvious during the course of this study that making this test reliably quantitative would be a further significant advantage. We have found that, in PBN, a buffer which contains BSA and sodium azide, IH4-RBD is stable for over 6 months at room temperature, and that PBN also improves HAT performance compared to using straight PBS. We also show that performing HAT at either 4{degrees}C, room temperature or 37{degrees}C has minimal influence on the results, and that quantitative evaluation of the levels of antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD can be achieved in a single step using titration of the IH4-RBD reagent. The HAT-field protocol described here requires only very simple disposable equipment and a few microliters of whole blood, such as can be obtained by finger prick. Because it is based on a single soluble reagent, the test can be adapted very simply and rapidly to detect antibodies against variants of the SARS-CoV-2, or conceivably against different pathogens. HAT-field appears well suited to provide quantitative assessments of the serological protection of populations as well as individuals, and given its very low cost, the stability of the IH4-RBD reagent in the adapted buffer, and the simplicity of the procedure, could be deployed pretty much anywhere, including in the poorest countries and the most remote corners of the globe.",2022-01-14,"Joly, E.; Maurel Ribes, A.",,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/052f6750040ceb3b0639984b30f1e45f872318ec.json,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.14.22268980; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.01.14.22268980v1?rss=1,245933572.0

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional, single-center study in Kunming, China. A total of 33 mild COVID-19 cases were divided into two treatment groups (with and without glucocorticoids, methylprednisolone, were used in this setting), and the absolute value of peripheral blood lymphocyte count; CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell counts; and the time to achieve negative transformation of a nucleic acid pharyngeal swab were recorded. Peripheral blood lymphocyte and T cell counts were compared between the treatment group and 25 healthy individuals. At the point of time when there was a 50% accumulation conversion rate (positive to negative nucleic acid on pharyngeal swab), and the nucleic acid turned negative in half of the patients in two groups, the peripheral blood lymphocyte and T cell counts were compared between treatment groups. RESULTS: The mean cumulative time for the 50% negative conversion rate of the nucleic acid in the pharyngeal swab was 17.7 ± 5.1 days and 13.9 ± 5.4 days in the glucocorticoid group and the nonglucocorticoid group, respectively. The absolute peripheral blood lymphocyte count and the T cell subset count in the glucocorticoid group were lower than those in the nonglucocorticoid group. When the nucleic acid turned negative in half of the patients, the absolute value of peripheral blood lymphocyte count and CD4+ T cells of the glucocorticoid group and the nonglucocorticoid group was not significantly different; the CD3+ and CD8+ T cells in the glucocorticoid group were lower than those in the nonglucocorticoid group. The absolute peripheral blood lymphocyte count, CD3+ T cells, and CD4+ T cells in the glucocorticoid group were lower than those of the healthy group during the whole disease period, and CD8+ T cells returned to normal at 19-21 days of the disease period. There was no significant difference between the nonglucocorticoid group and the healthy group for absolute peripheral blood lymphocyte and CD8+ T cells; moreover, CD3+ T cells and CD4+ T cells were lower in the nonglucocorticoid group than those in the healthy group from the day of admission to the 18th day and returned to normal at the period of 19-21 days. The absolute peripheral lymphocyte count (P = 0.048, effect size d = 0.727) and T cell subset count (CD3: P = 0.042, effect size d = 0.655; CD4: P < 0.01, effect size d = 0.599; and CD8: P = 0.034, effect size d = 0.550) in the nonglucocorticoid group were higher than those in the glucocorticoid group, and the difference between the groups was statistically significant.

Additional conditions complicating the diagnosis are the presence of risk factors for PE in almost all patients with COVID-19, as well as the overlap of the clinical presentation between PE and COVID-19. Materials and Methods: Therefore we conducted a single-center study at the Heart and Brain Hospital, Pleven in the period December 2020-February 2021. It included 27 consecutively hospitalized patients with recent pneumonia caused by Covid-19 and clinical presentation referring to PE. The cohort was divided into two groups - with and without a definitive diagnosis of PE, proven by CT pulmoangiography. The aim was to find the indicators that predict the presence of PE in patients with acute or Post-acute COVID-19 conditions. Results: Our results show that part of the ECG criteria - S-wave over 1.5 mm in I lead and aVL (p = 0.007), Q-wave in III and aVF (p = 0.020), as well as the D-dimer as quantitative variable (p = 0.025) proved to be independent predictors of PE. The RV/ LV diameter ratios [≥]1.0 as well as right ventricular dysfunction showed sensitivity 62.5%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value 100% and negative such 86.4% to verify the PE diagnosis[lcy] We suggest that the cut-off value of D-dimer of 1032 ng/ml has an optimal sensitivity (Se) of 87.5%, specificity (Sp) 57.9%, positive a predictive value (PPV) 46.7% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 91.7% for the diagnosis of PE (p = 0.021). Conclusion: Against the background of acute and Post-acute COVID-19 conditions ECG and EchoCG criteria remain predictive of PE. We suggest that a higher D-dimer cut-off value should be applied in COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 patients in order to confirm/dismiss the diagnosis PE.",2021-06-25,"Yakova-Hristova, D.; Simova, I.; Pavlov, P.; Hristov, M.; Kundurzhiev, T.; Dimitrov, N.; Vekov, T.",,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/68c3c55c0b433bfd8cfd448c9bd38df3c3a1d835.json,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.24.21258842; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.24.21258842v1?rss=1,235632067.0

Numerous approaches have been developed to lower blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients, most of them involving pharmacological treatments. Within this context, natural bioactive compounds have emerged as a promising alternative to drugs in HTN prevention. This work reviews not only the mechanisms of BP regulation by these antihypertensive compounds, but also their efficacy depending on consumption time. Although a plethora of studies has investigated food-derived compounds, such as phenolic compounds or peptides and their impact on BP, only a few addressed the relevance of time consumption. However, it is known that BP and its main regulatory mechanisms show a 24-h oscillation. Moreover, evidence shows that phenolic compounds can interact with clock genes, which regulate the biological rhythm followed by many physiological processes.

Psychological therapies are considered first-line intervention for people with chronic pain. Common psychological therapies require extensive clinician training and specialist qualifications. One approach that does not need lengthy training nor specialist qualification, but has empirical support in other health domains, is behavioural activation (BA). BA seeks to increase engagement in behaviours that are valued by the person and progress through behaviours that can increase mood and develop skills that build satisfying routines. BA can help people to manage their condition through scheduling behaviours, promoting routine and mastery over their condition. The extent to which BA has been used to support people living with chronic pain is not clear. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This scoping review aims to identify published studies describing the application of BA to support people living with chronic pain. To map the evidence regarding BA and chronic pain, including the study type and the associated evidence, a scoping review was adopted. The search will be conducted in bibliographic databases, clinical trial registries and grey literature. No date limits will be applied to the search strategy. Screening of titles and abstracts, and full-text screening, will be independently undertaken by two investigators using Covidence software. Any disagreement between investigators will be resolved by a third investigator. Data from included publications will be extracted using a customised data extraction tool. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The scoping review is an analysis of existing data and therefore ethics approval is not required. The findings of this scoping review will further our understanding of how BA has been used to support people living with chronic pain and inform future training and education programmes in this area.",2021,"Walsh, Sandra; Jones, Martin; Gray, Richard John; Gillam, Marianne; Gunn, Kate M; Barker, Trevor; Eshetie, Tesfahun; Moseley, G Lorimer",BMJ Open,,#covidwho-1455707,,,,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-041036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34083325/,235334056.0

Pregnant women already exhibit an elevated risk for depression compared to the general public, a pattern expected to be exacerbated by the pandemic. Certain lifestyle factors, including moderate exercise, may help support mental health during pregnancy, but it is unclear how the pandemic may impact these associations across different locations. Here, we test whether: (i) reported exercise routine alterations during the pandemic are associated with depression scores; and, (ii) the likelihood of reporting pandemic-related exercise changes varies between women living in metro areas and those in non-metro areas. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data from the COVID-19 And Reproductive Effects (CARE) study, an online survey of pregnant women in the United States. Participants were recruited April-June 2020 (n = 1,856). Linear regression analyses assessed whether reported COVID-19-related exercise change was associated with depression score as measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Survey. Logistic regression analyses tested whether a participant’s Rural-Urban Continuum Code classification of “metro” was linked with higher odds of reporting exercise changes compared to a “non-metro” classification. RESULTS: Women who reported exercise changes during the pandemic exhibited significantly higher depression scores compared to those reporting no changes. Moreover, individuals living in metro areas of all sizes were significantly more likely to report exercise changes compared to women living in non-metro areas. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the ability to maintain an exercise routine during the pandemic may help support maternal mental health. It may therefore be prudent for providers to explicitly ask patients how the pandemic has impacted their exercise routines and consider altered exercise routines a potential risk factor for depression. An effort should also be made to recommend exercises that are tailored to individual space restrictions and physical health.",2020-12-21,"Gildner, Theresa E.; Laugier, Elise J.; Thayer, Zaneta M.",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/f4f1f22b8eda4878b206f1cecf38b6873ddde38f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8c4b18250f3fed89ce3a0ab9e66e266394b20d02.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7751871.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33347484/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243188,229352684.0

Because ACE-2 may be modulated by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), there is concern that patients treated with ACEIs and ARBs are at higher risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. AIM: This study sought to analyze the association of COVID-19 pneumonia with previous treatment with ACEIs and ARBs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 684 consecutive patients hospitalized for suspected COVID-19 pneumonia and tested by polymerase chain reaction assay. Patients were split into two groups, according to whether (group 1, n = 484) or not (group 2, n = 250) COVID-19 was confirmed. Multivariable adjusted comparisons included a propensity score analysis. RESULTS: The mean age was 63.6 ± 18.7 years, and 302 patients (44%) were female. Hypertension was present in 42.6% and 38.4% of patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively (P = 0.28).

As of February 29, 2020, a total of 91 confirmed cases had been reported in Gansu Province. This case report of the diagnosis and treatment of an elderly patient with 2019-nCoV pneumonia complicated by acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Gansu Province aims to provide a better reference for the treatment of patients in the future. CASE SUMMARY: The patient, a 94-year-old female, lived in Maiji District of Tianshui, Gansu Province, China. On January 30, 2020, she was admitted to the Fourth People’s Hospital of Tianshui after 9 d of close contact with a patient with 2019-nCoV pneumonia. She was subsequently admitted to Gansu Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine for isolation and transferred to Tianshui Gansu Provincial Hospital of Infectious Diseases on February 3, 2020 for treatment. Upon initial examination, her body temperature was 36.7 °C , pulse was 80, breathing was 20, and blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg. She was conscious with normal development and normal nutrition. The pharynx was not red, and bilateral tonsils were not red and swollen. The lungs sounded slightly coarse with no dry or wet rales. The first symptoms were cough and fatigue on 2 February. The patient was hospitalized for 12 d. After active treatment, she was discharged on February 14 with a good prognosis. CONCLUSION: A history of exposure to the affected area or patient is a major cause of 2019-nCoV infection, and population clustering is a high risk factor for transmission. Patients may not necessarily have respiratory system symptoms as the only clinical manifestation but may also have concomitant or first onset digestive symptoms. Attention should be paid to the prevention and treatment of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Nucleic acid testing is extremely important and needs to be repeated several times.

The aim was “to ascertain the characteristics of patients, uncertainty over diagnosis, or features of the emergency response to the pandemic that could be modified to mitigate against future excess deaths”. METHODS: Review of the entire pathway of care of patients whose death was registered in Salford during the 8 week period of the first wave (primary care, secondary care, 111 and 999 calls) in order to create a single record of healthcare prior to death. An expert panel judged avoidability of death against the National Mortality Case Record Review Programme scale. The panel identified themes using a structured judgement review format. RESULTS: There were 522 deaths including 197 in hospital, and 190 in care homes. 51% of patients were female, 81% Caucasian, age 79 ± 9 years. Dementia was present in 35%, COVID-19 was cause of death in 44%. Healthcare contact prior to death was most frequently with primary care (81% of patients). Forty-six patients (9%) had healthcare appointments cancelled (median 1 cancellation, range 1–9). Fewer than half of NHS 111 calls were answered during this period. 18% of deaths contained themes consistent with some degree of avoidability. In people aged ≥75 years who lived at home this was 53%, in care home residents 29% and in patients with learning disability 44% (n = 9). Common themes were; delays in patients presenting to care providers (10%), delays in testing (17%), avoidable exposure to COVID-19 (26%), delays in provider response (5%), and sub-optimal care (11%). For avoidability scores of 2 or 3 (indicating more than 50% chance of avoidability), 44% of cases had > 2 themes. CONCLUSIONS: The initial emergency response had unforeseen consequences resulting in late presentation, sub-optimal assessments, and delays in receiving care. Death in more vulnerable groups was more likely to display avoidability themes.

This characteristic is unusual and seems specific to COVID‐19 infections, especially in their severe form. Viral infections can trigger acquired thrombophilia, which can then lead to thrombotic complications. We investigate for the presence of acquired thrombophilia, which could participate in this phenomenon, and report its prevalence. We also wonder if these thrombophilias participate in the bad prognosis of severe COVID‐19 infections. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 89 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID‐19 infection, we found a 20% prevalence of PS (protein S) deficiency and a high (ie, 72%) prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies: mainly lupus anticoagulant. The presence of PS deficiency or antiphospholipid antibodies was not linked with a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time nor with D‐dimer, fibrinogen, or CRP (C‐reactive protein) concentrations. These coagulation abnormalities are also not linked with thrombotic clinical events occurring during hospitalization nor with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: We assess a high prevalence of positive tests detecting thrombophilia in COVID‐19 infections. However, in our series, these acquired thrombophilias are not correlated with the severity of the disease nor with the occurrence of thrombotic events. Albeit the strong thrombotic tendency in COVID‐19 infections, the presence of frequent acquired thrombophilia may be part of the inflammation storm of COVID‐19 and should not systematically modify our strategy on prophylactic anticoagulant treatment, which is already revised upwards in this pathological condition.

We carried out an ecological study to assess the association between long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) on COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality after accounting for demographic, socioeconomic and meteorological variables. The study was based on publicly available data. Multivariable negative binomial mixed regression models were fitted, and results were reported in terms of incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMR). The effect of winter temperature and humidity was modelled through restricted cubic spline. Data from 1,439 municipalities out of 1,507 (95%) were included in the analyses, leading to a total of 61,377 COVID-19 cases and 40,401 deaths from all-causes collected from February 20(th) to April 16(th) and from March 1(st) to April 30(th), 2020, respectively. Several demographic and socioeconomic variables resulted significantly associated with COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality in a multivariable fashion. An increase in average winter temperature was associated with a nonlinear decrease in COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality, while an opposite trend emerged for the absolute humidity. An increase of 10 μg/m(3) in the mean annual concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 over the previous years was associated with a 58% and 34% increase in COVID-19 incidence rate, respectively. Similarly, a 10 μg/m(3) increase of annual mean PM2.5 concentration was associated with a 23% increase in all-cause mortality. An inverse association was found between NO(2) levels and COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality.

Alternatively, the use of convalescent plasma (CP) therapy relies on the transfer of the immunoglobulin repertoire of a donor that has recovered from the disease as a means of passive vaccination. While the lack of an effective antiviral treatment inadvertently increases the interest in CP products, initial clinical evaluation on COVID-19 patients revealed that critical factors determining the outcome of CP therapy need to be defined clearly if clinical efficacy is to be expected. Measurement of neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 using wildtype virus presents a reliable functional assay but the availability of suitable BSL3 facilities for virus culture restricts its applicability. Instead, the use of pseudovirus particles containing elements from the SARS-CoV-2 virus is widely applied to determine the activity of CP or other neutralizing agents such as monoclonal antibodies. In this study, we present our approach to optimize GFP-encoding lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Membrane proteins for use in neutralization assays. Our results show the feasibility of pseudovirus production using a C-terminal truncated Spike protein which is greatly enhanced by the incorporation of the D614G mutation. Moreover, we report that the use of Sodium Butyrate during lentiviral vector production dramatically increases pseudovirus titers. Analysis of CP neutralizing activity against particles pseudotyped with wildtype or D614G mutant Spike protein in the presence or absence the M protein revealed differential activity in CP samples that did not necessarily correlate with the amount of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Our results indicate that the extent of neutralizing activity in CP samples depends on the quality rather than the quantity of the humoral immune responses and varies greatly between donors. Functional screening of neutralizing activity using pseudovirus-based neutralization assays must be accepted as a critical tool for choosing CP donors if clinical efficacy is to be maximized.",2020-12-29,"Pamukcu, Cevriye; Celik, Elif; Ergun, Ebru Zeynep; Karahan, Zeynep Sena; Turkoz, Gozde; Aras, Mertkaya; Eren, Canan; Sili, Uluhan; Bilgin, Huseyin; Suder, Ilke; Mandaci, Baris Can; Dingiloglu, Baran; Tatli, Ozge; Doganay, Gizem Dinler; Baris, Safa; Ozoren, Nesrin; Sutlu, Tolga",bioRxiv,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e0f68ef7871e6e120c54fd714fbf64e472b165bf.json,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.28.424590,230716753.0

Machine learning combined with non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) has recently been shown to have the potential to diagnose MDD. However, most of these studies analyzed small samples of participants recruited from a single source, raising serious concerns about the generalizability of these results in clinical practice. Thus, it has become critical to re-evaluate the efficacy of various common EEG features for MDD detection across large and diverse datasets. To address this issue, we collected resting-state EEG data from 400 participants across four medical centers and tested classification performance of four common EEG features: band power (BP), coherence, Higuchi’s fractal dimension, and Katz’s fractal dimension. Then, a sequential backward selection (SBS) method was used to determine the optimal subset. To overcome the large data variability due to an increased data size and multi-site EEG recordings, we introduced the conformal kernel (CK) transformation to further improve the MDD as compared with the healthy control (HC) classification performance of support vector machine (SVM). The results show that (1) coherence features account for 98% of the optimal feature subset; (2) the CK-SVM outperforms other classifiers such as K-nearest neighbors (K-NN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and SVM; (3) the combination of the optimal feature subset and CK-SVM achieves a high five-fold cross-validation accuracy of 91.07% on the training set (140 MDD and 140 HC) and 84.16% on the independent test set (60 MDD and 60 HC).

In addition to an aspatial regression model, we conduct spatial lag, spatial error, and spatial autoregressive combined models to systematically examine the role of spatial structure in shaping geographical disparities in COVID-19 period prevalence. RESULTS: The aspatial ordinary least squares regression model tends to overestimate the COVID-19 period prevalence among counties with low observed rates, but this issue can be effectively addressed by spatial modeling. Spatial models can better estimate the period prevalence for counties, especially along the Atlantic coasts and through the Black Belt. Overall, the model fit among counties along both coasts is generally good with little variability evident, but in the Plain states, model fit is conspicuous in its heterogeneity across counties.

Different speculations that may unfold the mystery in the future are taking roots, but now there is no globally acceptable opinion about the origin and spread of this novel coronavirus. It is reported that Wuhan city of Hubei Province of central China was the epicenter of this outbreak of novel coronavirus. However, initial inadequate preventive measures allowed the infection to cross the borders of China and that pulls the world into drastic public health and economic crisis. This coronavirus disease now named as COVID-19 by World Health Organization (WHO) and the responsible coronavirus is named as “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).” The spread of SARS-CoV-2 is alarming even after 5 months of inception and WHO further warns the world to be prepared for more intense spread of COVID-19. Different diagnostic tools to detect SARS-CoV-2 are being used around the globe, but the identification of asymptomatic carriers of the disease is a serious challenge in countering the COVID-19 pandemic.

These workers and their dependents are in a socially vulnerable and economically difficult situation due to the dire impacts of the COVID-19. Migrant workers from Bangladesh in other countries are facing adverse impacts such as unemployment, short working hours, isolation, poor quality of living, social discrimination and mental pressure while their dependents at home are facing financial crisis due to the limited or reduced cash flow from their working relatives. A significant number of migrant workers have been sent back to Bangladesh and many are in constant fear of being sent back due to the impacts of COVID-19 in their host countries. Thus, COVID-19 intensifies numerous socio-economic crises such as joblessness, consumption of reserve funds by family members, and shrinking of the country’s remittance inflow.

This paper presents the design and implementation of a novel Internet of Things (IoT) device, called MEIoT weather station, which incorporates an exogenous disturbance input, within the National Digital Observatory of Smart Environments (OBNiSE) architecture. The exogenous disturbance input involves a wind blower based on a DC brushless motor. It can be controlled, via Node-RED platform, manually through a sliding bar, or automatically via different predefined profile functions, modifying the wind speed and the wind vane sensor variables. An application to Engineering Education is presented with a case study that includes the instructional design for the least-squares regression topic for linear, quadratic, and cubic approximations within the Educational Mechatronics Conceptual Framework (EMCF) to show the relevance of this proposal.

Although in vitro studies showed detoxification capacity of PA in sheep, few field data are available to ascertain whether grazing sheep can both tolerate and reduce ragwort. In a two-year study in a ragwort-rich pasture with a stocking density of 12 sheep/hectare, we documented (1) the extent of voluntarily ingested ragwort, (2) the correlation of nutritional parameters and feeding behavior, and (3) the impact of grazing on the yield proportion and number of flowers of dominant plants. Every six weeks the vegetation underwent a botanical survey and a chemical analysis. Sheep continuously ingested ragwort between 1.2 and 4.9 kg (2020) and 1.0 and 2.2 kg (2021) per individual per day without any impact on animal health. The more biomass ragwort produced, the more it contained sugar (r = 0.59-0.74), and the more sheep ingested it (r = 0.94-0.95). Other herbs increased their yield proportion from 23.3 to 36.5%, while that of ragwort decreased from 26.3 to 18.8% (2020/2021), doubling its flowers.

Furthermore, programming stimulates logical thinking, which impacts other personal abilities. Health science students have limited exposure to programming during their studies. Aware of this and considering the prolonged time in social distancing in Brazil due to the SARS-COV2 pandemic in 2020, we organized an outreach course dedicated to teaching introductory concepts of programming for health science students. The activity was developed fully online using the Zoom web conference agent, lasting 12 wk (8 synchronous classes, 15 synchronous hours in total), and attended by 27 undergraduate and graduate students from two different universities. A collaborative problem-based learning and group-learning methodology were developed through asynchronous homework and mainly online synchronous activities. In this article, we describe our approach and provide some suggestions for replicating the course in other universities. We observed that the activities of the outreach course improved programming skills and confidence for most of the students. More importantly, it piqued their interest enough to motivate them to continue to practice writing and testing their programs.

In this report we have studied the interaction of dengue viruses produced in insect cells, tumor cell lines, and primary human dendritic cells (DCs) with DC-SIGN and L-SIGN. Virus produced in primary DCs is unable to interact with DC-SIGN but remains infectious for L-SIGN–expressing cells. Skin-resident DCs may thus be a site of initial infection by insect-produced virus, but DCs will likely not participate in large-scale virus replication during dengue infection.

In order to minimize cardiac tissue injury, primary per-cutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) as treatment of choice should be performed as soon as possible. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) as an ongoing major global concern affects the other parts of health care system. Applying preventive strategies during this outbreak is necessary. However, critical times in STEMI management and outcomes may be influenced by infection control protocols implementation. The aim of this study is to investigate the differences in time intervals related to STEMI care and 15-day major adverse cardiac events (MACE) during this outbreak compared with the same period in last year and to determine whether the STEMI protocol should be changed to thrombolytic therapy during COVID-19 outbreak or not. Methods and results: The patients with STEMI who underwent PPCI in Tehran Heart Center were included. Chest Computed tomography (CT) imaging and real time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) were only performed for COVID-19 suspected patients. Seventy-seven patients from 29th February to 29th March 2020 were compared with 62 patients from 1st to 30th March 2019. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by rRT-PCR in 5 cases. CT imaging in 4 out of 5 patients was in favor of COVID-19. The median of door-to-device time was reduced 13 minutes during this outbreak (p :0.007). In-hospital mortality before and during outbreak was 3.22% and 5.19%, respectively (p: 0.57). Confirmed infection with COVID-19 was only reported in one of expired cases. The difference in 15-day MACE between two time periods was not statistically significant.

In the COVID‐19 pandemic, it is urgent to understand the effects of antitumor therapy on the prognosis of patients with COVID‐19. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, MedRxiv, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) until 21 June 2020. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were evaluated using a random effects model to analyze the effects of antitumor therapies on COVID‐19 patients. RESULTS: For cancer patients with COVID‐19, the death events related to antitumor treatment were higher than those with no antitumor treatment (OR = 1.55; 95% CI 1.07–2.25; p = 0.021). Compared with patients in the survival group, the non‐survival group showed no significant differences in patients who received antitumor therapy. Compared with patients in the non‐severe group, the severe group was more likely to receive antitumor therapy (OR = 1.50; 95% CI 1.02–2.19; p = 0.037) and there was a significant difference.

Firmicutes are reduced in the intestinal microbiota of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). In a phase 1b trial of patients with UC, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of SER-287, an oral formulation of Firmicutes spores, and the effects of vancomycin preconditioning on expansion (engraftment) of SER-287 species in the colon. Methods We conducted a double-blind trial of SER-287 in 58 adults with active mild-to-moderate UC (modified Mayo scores 4–10, endoscopic subscores ≥1). Participants received 6 days of preconditioning with oral vancomycin (125 mg, 4 times daily) or placebo followed by 8 weeks of oral SER-287 or placebo. Patients were randomly assigned (2:3:3:3) to groups that received placebo followed by either placebo or SER-287 once weekly, or vancomycin followed by SER-287 once weekly or SER-287 once daily. Clinical endpoints included safety and clinical remission (modified Mayo score ≤ 2; endoscopic subscores 0 or 1). Microbiome endpoints included SER-287 engraftment (dose species detected in stool after, but not before, SER-287 administration). Engraftment of SER-287 and changes in microbiome composition and associated metabolites were measured by analyses of stool specimens collected at baseline, after preconditioning, and during and 4 weeks after administration of SER-287 or placebo. Results Proportions of patients with adverse events did not differ significantly among groups. A higher proportion of patients in the vancomycin/SER-287 daily group (40%) achieved clinical remission at week 8 than patients in the placebo/placebo group (0), placebo/SER-287 weekly group (13.3%), or vancomycin/SER-287 weekly group (17.7%) (P=.024 for vancomycin/SER-287 daily vs placebo/placebo). By day 7, higher numbers of SER-287 dose species were detected in stool samples from all SER-287 groups compared with the placebo group (P<.05), but this difference was not maintained beyond day 7 in the placebo/SER-287 weekly group. In the vancomycin groups, a greater number of dose species were detected in stool collected on day 10 and all subsequent time points, through 4 weeks post-dosing, compared with the placebo group (P<.05). A higher number of SER-287 dose species were detected in stool samples on days 7 and 10 from subjects who received daily vs weekly SER-287 doses (P<.05). Changes in fecal microbiome composition and metabolites were associated with both vancomycin/SER-287 groups. Conclusions In this small phase 1b trial of limited duration, the safety and tolerability of SER-287 were similar to placebo. SER-287 following vancomycin was significantly more effective than placebo for induction of remission in patients with active mild-to-moderate UC.

An online survey (N = 1,199) examined the relationships among media trust, emotional and cognitive reactions to COVID-19 information overload, media attention, and risk perceptions regarding COVID-19. Participants' media attention (exposure and attention combined) to information about the pandemic was positively related to their risk perceptions (perceived susceptibility and severity) about the disease. Media attention was dependent on participants' trust in the media as valid sources of information, but also on their cognitive and emotional reactions to COVID-19 information overload. In response to this overload, they produced negative thoughts and more negative (fear and anger) than positive (protection) emotions. These distinct reactions had differential effects on media attention and risk perceptions. Fear and protection were positively related to media attention and risk perceptions, while anger and negative thinking undermined attention and perceptions.

The use of blends and the choice of polymer additive strongly affected the performance of the polycrystalline TFTs, and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) blend TFTs exhibited a high mobility exceeding 4 cm2/(V s) and small device-to-device variations. Using extended techniques in atomic force microscopy (AFM), we investigated the thin-film morphologies by bimodal AFM and the carrier transport properties by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). We demonstrated that the PMMA blend system enables the formation of a well-ordered polycrystalline thin film induced by vertical phase separation between the OSC and PMMA over a large area, resulting in uniform TFT performance.

RESULTS: Using the viral metagenomic approach, we investigated the virome of cloacal swab specimens collected from 3182 birds (the majority of them wild species) consisting of > 87 different species in 10 different orders within the Aves classes. The virus diversity in wild birds was higher than that in breeding birds. We acquired 707 viral genomes from 18 defined families and 4 unclassified virus groups, with 265 virus genomes sharing < 60% protein sequence identities with their best matches in GenBank comprising new virus families, genera, or species. RNA viruses containing the conserved RdRp domain with no phylogenetic affinity to currently defined virus families existed in different bird species. Genomes of the astrovirus, picornavirus, coronavirus, calicivirus, parvovirus, circovirus, retrovirus, and adenovirus families which include known avian pathogens were fully characterized. Putative cross-species transmissions were observed with viruses in wild birds showing > 95% amino acid sequence identity to previously reported viruses in domestic poultry. Genomic recombination was observed for some genomes showing discordant phylogenies based on structural and non-structural regions. Mapping the next-generation sequencing (NGS) data respectively against the 707 genomes revealed that these viruses showed distribution pattern differences among birds with different habitats (breeding or wild), orders, and sampling sites but no significant differences between birds with different behavioral features (migratory and resident).

TMEM106A is a type II transmembrane protein localized on the plasma membrane and can be incorporated into HIV-1 virion particles. Through intermolecular interactions of its C-terminal domains on virion particle and plasma membrane, TMEM106A traps virion particles to the cell surface. HIV-1 Env interacts with TMEM106A to interfere with the intermolecular interactions and partially suppresses its antiviral activity.

In vitro, VIP and PACAP, highly similar neuropeptides, decreased the SARS-CoV-2 genome replication in human monocytes and viral production in lung epithelial cells, also reducing cell death. Both neuropeptides inhibited the production of proinflammatory mediators in lung epithelial cells and in monocytes. VIP and PACAP prevented in monocytes the SARS-CoV-2-induced activation of NF-kB and SREBP1 and SREBP2, transcriptions factors involved in proinflammatory reactions and lipid metabolism, respectively. They also promoted CREB activation, a transcription factor with antiapoptotic activity and negative regulator of NF-kB.

Whether neutrophil count can serve as a predictor of adverse treatment outcomes is unknown. METHODS: We prospectively assessed 936 patients (172 HIV-seropositive) with culture-confirmed pulmonary TB, enrolled in a multicenter prospective cohort study from different regions in Brazil, from June 2015 to June 2019, and were followed up to two years. TB patients had a baseline visit before treatment (month 0) and visits at month 2 and 6 (or at the end of TB treatment). Smear microscopy, and culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) were performed at TB diagnosis and during follow-up. Complete blood counts were measured at baseline. Treatment outcome was defined as either unfavorable (death, treatment failure or TB recurrence) or favorable (cure or treatment completion). We performed multivariable logistic regression, with propensity score regression adjustment, to estimate the association between neutrophil count with MTB culture result at month 2 and unfavorable treatment outcome. We used a propensity score adjustment instead of a fully adjusted regression model due to the relatively low number of outcomes. RESULTS: Among 682 patients who had MTB culture results at month 2, 40 (5.9%) had a positive result. After regression with propensity score adjustment, no significant association between baseline neutrophil count (10(3)/mm(3)) and positive MTB culture at month 2 was found among either HIV-seronegative (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = [0.95;1.19] or HIV-seropositive patients (OR = 0.77, 95% CI = [0.51; 1.20]). Of 691 TB patients followed up for at least 18 months and up to 24 months, 635 (91.9%) were either cured or completed treatment, and 56 (8.1%) had an unfavorable treatment outcome. A multivariable regression with propensity score adjustment found an association between higher neutrophil count (10(3)/mm(3)) at baseline and unfavorable outcome among HIV-seronegative patients [OR= 1.17 (95% CI= [1.06;1.30]). In addition, adjusted Cox regression found that higher baseline neutrophil count (10(3)/mm(3)) was associated with unfavorable treatment outcomes overall and among HIV-seronegative patients (HR= 1.16 (95% CI = [1.05;1.27]). CONCLUSION: Increased neutrophil count prior to anti-TB treatment initiation was associated with unfavorable treatment outcomes, particularly among HIV-seronegative patients.

Despite significant efforts, many limitations and biases exist in previously developed AI diagnostic models for COVID-19. Utilizing a large set of local and international CXR images, we developed an AI model with high performance on temporal and external validation. Objective: Investigate real-time performance of an AI-enabled COVID-19 diagnostic support system across a 12-hospital system. Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: Labeled frontal CXR images (samples of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19) from the M Health Fairview (Minnesota, USA), Valencian Region Medical ImageBank (Spain), MIMIC-CXR, Open-I 2013 Chest X-ray Collection, GitHub COVID-19 Image Data Collection (International), Indiana University (Indiana, USA), and Emory University (Georgia, USA) Participants: Internal (training, temporal, and real-time validation): 51,592 CXRs; Public: 27,424 CXRs; External (Indiana University): 10,002 CXRs; External (Emory University): 2002 CXRs Main Outcome and Measure: Model performance assessed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC), Precision-Recall curves, and F1 score. Results: Patients that were COVID-19 positive had significantly higher COVID-19 Diagnostic Scores (median .1 [IQR: 0.0-0.8] vs median 0.0 [IQR: 0.0-0.1], p < 0.001) than patients that were COVID-19 negative. Pre-implementation the AI-model performed well on temporal validation (AUROC 0.8) and external validation (AUROC 0.76 at Indiana U, AUROC 0.72 at Emory U).

The genetic cause for about half of the individuals affected by HMN/CMT2 remains unknown. Here, we report the identification of pathogenic variants in GBF1 (Golgi brefeldin A-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1) in four unrelated families with individuals affected by sporadic or dominant HMN/CMT2. Genomic sequencing analyses in seven affected individuals uncovered four distinct heterozygous GBF1 variants, two of which occurred de novo. Other known HMN/CMT2-implicated genes were excluded. Affected individuals show HMN/CMT2 with slowly progressive distal muscle weakness and musculoskeletal deformities. Electrophysiological studies confirmed axonal damage with chronic neurogenic changes. Three individuals had additional distal sensory loss. GBF1 encodes a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor that facilitates the activation of members of the ARF (ADP-ribosylation factor) family of small GTPases. GBF1 is mainly involved in the formation of coatomer protein complex (COPI) vesicles, maintenance and function of the Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria migration and positioning. We demonstrate that GBF1 is present in mouse spinal cord and muscle tissues and is particularly abundant in neuropathologically relevant sites, such as the motor neuron and the growth cone. Consistent with the described role of GBF1 in Golgi function and maintenance, we observed marked increase in Golgi fragmentation in primary fibroblasts derived from all affected individuals in this study.

Methods: Patients who fulfilled the 1997 ACR criteria for SLE and were followed in our hospital since 1995 were included. Patients were stratified into two groups according to the year of diagnosis: (1) 1995–2004 and (2) 2005–2018. Survival of patients was studied by Kaplan–Meier analysis. Organ damage as assessed by the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) damage index (SDI) and causes of death in the first 10 years of SLE onset was compared between the two groups. Cox regression was used to study factors associated with survival. Results: A total of 1,098 SLE patients were registered in our database. After excluding 157 patients diagnosed outside the time period of 1995–2018, 941 patients were studied (92% women). All were ethnic Chinese. The mean age of SLE onset was 35.1 ± 14.4 years, and the mean duration of observation was 13.1 ± 6.6 years. Seventy-seven (8.2%) patients were lost to follow-up. Groups 1 and 2 consisted of 364 and 577 patients, respectively. The mean SDI score at 10 years of disease onset was significantly higher in group 1 than group 2 patients (1.01 ± 1.43 vs. 0.57 ± 0.94; p < 0.01), particularly in the neuropsychiatric, musculoskeletal, and gonadal domains. Within 10 years of SLE onset, 32 (8.8%) patients in group 1 and 25 (4.3%) patients in group 2 died (p = 0.005). The 5- and 10-year cumulative survival rates were 93.6 and 91.0% in group 1 and 96.5 and 94.2% in group 2 patients, respectively (log-rank test p = 0.048). Infection accounted for more than half of the deaths in both groups. More group 1 than group 2 patients died of vascular events, but the difference was not statistically significant. Cox regression showed that the age of SLE onset and damage score accrued at 10 years, but not the time period in which SLE was diagnosed, were significantly associated with mortality. Conclusions: The improvement in survival of our SLE patients is probably related to the accrual of less organ damage in the past 15 years.",2020-09-11,"Mok, Chi Chiu; Ho, Ling Yin; Chan, Kar Li; Tse, Sau Mei; To, Chi Hung",Front Med (Lausanne),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/61489885fd8a0bd23a5c4896ed4c65fb693cd782.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7516076.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33015102/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.00552,221589077.0

Although nurses are indispensable healthcare professionals, programs to develop nurses with global health competencies and relevant studies are rare. Accordingly, this study was designed to develop a program to increase global health competencies and global leadership in nursing students and test its effect. Methods: A single group pre- and post-test study design was used. A 13-weeks program was developed and implemented with 204 students. Data were analyzed using paired t-test. The program to promote global health competencies was designed to improve nursing students' knowledge of global health, global leadership, global health competencies, critical thinking ability, and student-student partnership. Results: Global health competencies (t = −19.96, p < 0.001), self-assessed global leadership (t = −7.67, p < 0.001), and critical thinking ability (t = −7.67, p < 0.001) all significantly increased. Discussion: The study findings of increased global health competencies and global leadership in nursing students after participation in the program indicated ways in which global health competencies of nurses need to be developed. Therefore, the following aspects should be considered. First, nursing educators should understand the need and importance of global health education and accordingly, current nursing curriculums should be revised to include courses about global health. A systematic course of studies about global health should be developed and implemented based on discussions among experts and researchers. Second, as future health care professionals, nursing students should take an interest in global health problems and recognize various issues that need to be solved beyond borders between countries.

Calls to reform and defund the police received much attention in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd in May 2020. The Floyd killing also motivated Naomi Osaka to begin her criminal justice activism, which has generally been very well received. Adopting a constructionist perspective, I investigate how Osaka’s criminal justice activism has, in the broader context of the development of celebrity culture, been subjectively motivated and inter-subjectively received by the public and in the news media. Theoretically this paper has the two-fold objective of developing a model of the conditions favorable to the successful reception of celebrity activism and, additionally, of suggesting how such criminologically relevant activism can be understood in terms of a process of celebritization of criminal justice and police reform as causes worthy of attention.

Understanding the roles of such ‘superspreaders’ can be crucial in deciding where to direct disease surveillance and controls to greatest effect. In the epidemiology of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in Great Britain, it has been suggested that a minority of cattle farms or herds might make disproportionate contributions to the spread of Mycobacterium bovis, and hence might be considered ‘superspreader farms’. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: We review the literature to identify the characteristics of farms that have the potential to contribute to exceptional values in the three main components of the farm reproductive number ‐ R(f): contact rate, infectiousness and duration of infectiousness, and therefore might characterize potential superspreader farms for bovine tuberculosis in Great Britain. RESULTS: Farms exhibit marked heterogeneity in contact rates arising from between‐farm trading of cattle. A minority of farms act as trading hubs that greatly augment connections within cattle trading networks. Herd infectiousness might be increased by high within‐herd transmission or the presence of supershedding individuals, or infectiousness might be prolonged due to undetected infections or by repeated local transmission, via wildlife or fomites. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting control methods on putative superspreader farms might yield disproportionate benefits in controlling endemic bovine tuberculosis in Great Britain.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Our study reveals a clear correlation between the deterioration of the reported physical and mental state and impaired medical care for patients suffering from endometriosis during the COVID-19 pandemic. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The quality of life of patients suffering from endometriosis is compromised in a variety of aspects. In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, self-isolation practices aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19 have severely complicated the availability of proper medical care worldwide. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The study involved a cross-sectional international self-reported online survey. Responses were accepted between November 2020 and January 2021. The survey was prepared by the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in a medical university setting. The survey contained 17 questions and was placed online. Cooperation with different endometriosis organizations around the world enabled distribution of the survey through their social media platforms. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The study participants (n = 3024 replies) originated from 59 countries. The questionnaire was created after a literature review and is partially based on the validated quality of life questionnaires, adjusted to the study question. The survey was then translated to 15 other languages following World Health Organization recommendations as closely as possible. Chi-square tests for independence were carried out for the analysis of the two variables: suspension of health services, and the patients mental and physical well-being. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Out of 3024 participants from 59 countries who submitted the questionnaire between November 2020 and January 2021, 2964 (98.01%) provided information that enabled a full analysis. For the 1174 participants who had their medical appointments cancelled, 43.7% (n = 513) reported that their symptoms had been aggravated, and 49.3% (n = 579) reported that their mental state had worsened. In comparison, of the 1180 participants who kept their appointments, only 29.4% (n = 347) stated that their symptoms had been aggravated, and 27.5% (n = 325) stated their mental health had worsened. The results showed that there was a significant link between the reported deterioration of mental and physical wellbeing and impaired medical care (cancellation) (P ≪ 0.001). A total of 610 participants did not have medical appointments scheduled, and these participants followed a similar pattern as the participants who kept their appointments, with 29.0% (n = 177) reporting aggravation of symptoms and 28.2% (n = 172) reporting that their mental state had worsened. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Cultural differences among international participants are to be expected and this may have affected how participants from different countries interpreted and answered the questionnaire. Translating the questionnaire into 15 different languages, even though incorporating backwards translation, could possibly lead to different interpretations of given questions, simply based on different wording in the languages. The majority of respondents (around 90%) were from Europe and South America and therefore the findings may not be generalizable to other locations. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Further research is needed to assess the true impact and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for patients living with endometriosis.

The majority of gene expression studies of IBD are generated from heterogeneous biopsies, providing no distinction between immune cells, the epithelium and other mucosal cells. By using laser capture microdissection (LCM) coupled with RNA sequencing, we aimed to characterize the expressional changes of the isolated colonic epithelial monolayer from ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) patients compared to healthy controls (HC). The analysis identified 3706 genes as differentially expressed between active IBD epithelium and HC. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was used to stratify genes into modules, which were subsequently characterized using enrichment analysis. Our data show a distinct upregulation of the antigen presentation machinery during inflammation, including major histocompatibility complex class II molecules (e.g. HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DRA) and key transcription factors/activators (STAT1, IRF1, CIITA). We also see an epithelial downregulation of retinoic acid-responsive nuclear receptors (RARA, RARB, RXRA), but upregulation of retinoid-metabolizing enzymes (RDH11, ALDH1A2, ALDH1A3), which together suggest a perturbation of epithelial vitamin A signaling during active IBD. Lastly, we identified a cluster of stress-related genes, including activator protein 1 components JUNB and ATF3, as significantly upregulated in active UC but not in CD, revealing an interesting aspect of IBD heterogeneity.

To provide insight into whether these genetic similarities inform common modes of recognition, we determined structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike in complex with three VH1-2-derived antibodies: 2-15, 2-43, and H4. All three utilized VH1-2-encoded motifs to recognize the receptor-binding domain (RBD), with heavy chain N53I enhancing binding and light chain tyrosines recognizing F486RBD. Despite these similarities, class members bound both RBD-up and -down conformations of the spike, with a subset of antibodies utilizing elongated CDRH3s to recognize glycan N343 on a neighboring RBD – a quaternary interaction accommodated by an increase in RBD separation of up to 12 Å. The VH1-2-antibody class thus utilizes modular recognition encoded by modular genetic elements to effect potent neutralization, with VH-gene component specifying recognition of RBD and CDRH3 component specifying quaternary interactions.

We conducted a comprehensive mass spectrometric analysis of the N-glycosylation profiles of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins using signature ions-triggered electron-transfer/higher-energy collision dissociation (EThcD) mass spectrometry. The patterns of N-glycosylation within the recombinant ectodomain and S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were characterized using this approach. Significant variations were observed in the distribution of glycan types as well as the specific individual glycans on the modification sites of the ectodomain and subunit proteins. The relative abundance of sialylated glycans in the S1 subunit compared to the full-length protein could indicate differences in the global structure and function of these two species. In addition, we compared N-glycan profiles of the recombinant spike proteins produced from different expression systems, including human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells and Spodoptera frugiperda (SF9) insect cells.

The chondrogenesis initiates from the 12th week of intrauterine life and the development of condyle is associated with growth. The condylar cortication shows distinct morphological variation for each individual in each stage of their life. The cortical bone around the condyle could be used as a factor for chronological age assessment and it can act as a tool in forensic medicine. Aim and Objective: The study was carried out to evaluate the cortical grading in mandibular condyle using two different applications and to correlate their grades with chronological age. Setting and Design: Hospital-based retrospective observational cross-sectional study. Materials and Methods: The study was carried out in 40 patients and 80 TMJs were assessed for cortication grades in Carestream 3D imaging and Image J applications. These grading from both the applications were correlated with the chronological age. Statistical Analysis: SPSS (Statistical Analysis for the Social Science) - Cohen's Kappa inter-examiner reliability and Spearman's correlation coefficient were used. Results: The radiological assessment of condylar cortication in individual application showed significant results and the relationship of cortication with chronological age showed a significant correlation. Conclusion: The condylar cortication grading is a simple technique and can be used as a factor for chronological age assessment.

The virus is composed of the spike, membrane and envelope. On physiological smell, odoriferous substances bind to proteins secreted by sustentacular cells in order to be processed by olfactory receptor neurons. Olfactory disorder is one of the main manifestations of COVID-19, however, research is still required to clarify the mechanism involved in SARS-CoV-2 induced anosmia. OBJECTIVE: This article aims to analyze current scientific evidence intended to elucidate the pathophysiological relationship between COVID-19 and the cause of olfactory disorders. METHODS: Pubmed, Embase, Scopus and ScienceDirect were used to compose this article. The research was conducted on November 24th, 2020. Original articles with experimental studies in human, animal and in vitro, short communications, viewpoint, published in the English language and between 2019 and 2020 were included, all related to the pathophysiological relationship between olfactory disorders and COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Both human cell receptors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are essential for the SARS-CoV-2 entrance. These receptors are mostly present in the olfactory epithelium cells, therefore, the main hypothesis is that anosmia is caused due to damage to non-neuronal cells which, thereafter, affects the normal olfactory metabolism. Furthermore, magnetic resonance imaging studies exhibit a relationship between a reduction on the neuronal epithelium and the olfactory bulb atrophy. Damage to non-neuronal cells explains the average recovery lasting a few weeks. This injury can be exacerbated by an aggressive immune response, which leads to damage to neuronal cells and stem cells inducing a persistent anosmia. Conductive anosmia is not sufficient to explain most cases of COVID-19 induced anosmia. CONCLUSION: Olfactory disorders such as anosmia and hyposmia can be caused by COVID-19, the main mechanism is associated with olfactory epithelium damage, targeting predominantly non-neuronal cells. However, neuronal cells can also be affected, worsening the condition of olfactory loss.",2021-04-25,"Las Casas Lima, Mateus Henrique de; Cavalcante, Ana Luiza Brusiquesi; Leão, Sydney Correia",Braz J Otorhinolaryngol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/dd712543ccfe0850457b06b6cfd6035f918bf02c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8068782.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1808869421000732; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33965353/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjorl.2021.04.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1808869421000732,233390461.0

The NAP4 ‘s 10-year term is to be finished by the end of 2020. Several sectors demonstrate substantial success after approximately 8 years of introduction, while the other classes often lag behind the goal and progress quite slowly. Agricultural sector performance is affected by many problems and challenges. In acknowledgment of the poor success of this field, the Ministry of Agriculture and Agri-Based Industry has launched new approaches, policies, and programs that can change the agricultural sector more rapidly. The new direction is aimed at ensuring national food security and boosting farm and revenues.

In a bead based assay, different probe molecules are attached to different beads (of a few tens of microns in size), which are then reacted in suspension with the target sample. After reaction, the beads must be identifiable in order to determine the attached probe molecule, and thus each bead must be labelled (encoded) with a unique identifier.

Infection rates among employees are infrequently described. OBJECTIVE: To describe SARS-CoV-2 rates among SNF employees and residents during a non-outbreak time period, we measured cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 prevalence across multiple sites in the Seattle area. DESIGN: SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed for SNF employees and residents using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. A subset of employees completed a sociodemographic and symptom questionnaire. PARTICIPANTS: Between March 29 and May 13, 2020, we tested 1583 employees and 1208 residents at 16 SNFs for SARS-CoV-2. MAIN MEASURE: SARS-CoV-2 testing results and symptom report among employees and residents. KEY RESULTS: Eleven of the 16 SNFs had one or more resident or employee test positive. Overall, 46 (2.9%) employees had positive or inconclusive testing for SARS-CoV-2, and among those who completed surveys, most were asymptomatic and involved in direct patient care. The majority of employees tested were female (934, 73%), and most employees were Asian (392, 30%), Black (360, 28%), or white (360, 28%).

Thereupon, the development of high-yielding and drought-tolerant rice genotypes is imperative in order to sustain rice production and ensure global food security. The present study aimed to evaluate diverse exotic and local parental rice genotypes and their corresponding cross combinations under water-deficit versus well-watered conditions, determining general and specific combining ability effects, heterosis, and the gene action controlling important traits through half-diallel analysis. In addition, the research aimed to assess parental genetic distance (GD) employing simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, and to determine its association with hybrid performance, heterosis, and specific combining ability (SCA) effects. Six diverse rice genotypes (exotic and local) and their 15 F1 hybrids were assessed for two years under water-deficit and well-watered conditions. The results revealed that water-deficit stress substantially declined days to heading, plant height, chlorophyll content, relative water content, grain yield, and yield attributes. Contrarily, leaf rolling and the sterility percentage were considerably increased compared to well-watered conditions. Genotypes differed significantly for all the studied characteristics under water-deficit and well-watered conditions. Both additive and non-additive gene actions were involved in governing the inheritance of all the studied traits; however, additive gene action was predominant for most traits. The parental genotypes P1 and P2 were identified as excellent combiners for earliness and the breeding of short stature genotypes. Moreover, P3, P4, and P6 were identified as excellent combiners to increase grain yield and its attributes under water-deficit conditions. The hybrid combinations; P1 × P4, P2 × P5, P3 × P4, and P4 × P6 were found to be good specific combiners for grain yield and its contributed traits under water-deficit conditions. The parental genetic distance (GD) ranged from 0.38 to 0.89, with an average of 0.70. It showed lower association with hybrid performance, heterosis, and combining ability effects for all the studied traits. Nevertheless, SCA revealed a significant association with hybrid performance and heterosis, which suggests that SCA is a good predictor for hybrid performance and heterosis under water-deficit conditions. Strong positive relationships were identified between grain yield and each of relative water content, chlorophyll content, number of panicles/plant, number of filled grains/panicle, and 1000-grain weight.

Method 1015 asymptomatic volunteers were screened for SARS-CoV-2 by means of an oropharyngeal swab taken by qualified personnel and subsequent RT-PCR testing. Each participant additionally performed nasal self-swabs for two of the four rapid antigen tests at the same day according to the manufacturers instructions. Study participants transmitted a photo and own interpretation of their test results to the study center. The results of the two self-tests provided by the participants were correlated with the results of the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and independently assessed and evaluated by the study center. Results None of the volunteers tested positive upon RT-PCR, whereas 13 AG-ST showed a false positive test result (0.7%). The highest false positivity rate was found for the Clungene test (2.1% compared to 0.2% for the other tests), while the highest test failure rate (invalid) was found for the Mexacare test (3.7%). The Anbio and Hotgene tests produced the fewest false positive results when evaluated by the participants and also showed the best agreement among themselves. Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 Antigen rapid self- tests with higher false positive test rates, such as the Clungene test, or with high rates of invalid test results, such as the Mexacare test, are less suitable for screening purposes of asymptomatic study participants especially in low-prevalence settings. False positive or inadequate test results increase the burden on certified test laboratories due to verification PCR tests and cause a substantial economic loss due to unnecessary quarantine measurements and cause psychological stress in the affected study participants.

However, the roles of pyroptosis-related (PR) genes (PRGs) in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) remain elusive. In the present study, we constructed a novel PR risk signature through the lasso regression analysis. The risk signature was greatly conducive to PAAD prognostic assessment. PR risk score was identified as an independent prognostic factor and could distinguish the prognostic differences of most clinical subgroups. Meanwhile, it could improve the traditional prognostic models based on TNM-staging. Next, its prognostic value was also tested in five validation cohorts. Using CIBERSORT, ESTIMATE, and ssGSEA algorithms, the effects of PR risk signature on tumor immune microenvironment (TIM) were explored. High PR risk suppressed antitumor immune through decreasing the infiltrating levels of CD8 T and NK cells. The genomic information and histological expression of risk PRGs were uncovered by USCA and HPA databases. Somatic mutation, methylation alteration, and homozygous CNV of eight PRGs barely occurred in PAAD samples. As for therapeutic correlation, PR risk score may not predict the efficacy of PD-1/L1 inhibitors and was weakly associated with multiple drug susceptibilities. Finally, the biofunctions of toll like receptor 3 (TLR3) in pancreatic cancer (PC) cells were investigated through qPCR, MTT, colony formation, and Transwell assays. Overexpression of TLR3 could promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PC cells. In conclusion, PRGs play crucial roles in prognosis, progression, and immune microenvironment of PAAD.

This study examined the effects of PHWL on puffing behavior, subjective experiences, and toxicant exposures among low- and high-frequency WP smokers in the United States (US). METHODS: Sixty current (past-month) WP smokers (low-frequency; n = 30 and high-frequency; n = 30) completed two 45-min ad libitum WP smoking sessions in a cross-over design study (WP with no-PHWL vs. WP with PHWL).

RESULTS: Mean age of low-frequency smokers was 21.5 years and high-frequency smokers was 21.3 years. Compared to high-frequency, low-frequency smokers had significant reduction in average total smoking time [mean difference (SD) = -7.6 (10.2) min vs. -2.6 (6.7) min, p = 0.03] and number of puffs [mean difference (SD) = -33.37 (70.7) vs. -0.70 (29.2), p = 0.02] following exposure to PHWL compared to no-PHWL condition. Post-session subjective experiences were lower among high-frequency smokers compared to low-frequency smokers following smoking WP with PHWL compared to the no-PHWL session (puff liking -1.2 vs. -0.5; puff satisfaction -1.0 vs. -0.3; craving reduction -0.5 vs. 1.2) (p < 0.05 for all).

Previous reviews have summarized social media uses for a specific health purpose such as health interventions, health campaigns, medical education, and disease outbreak surveillance. The most recent comprehensive review of social media uses for health purposes, however, was conducted in 2013. A systematic review that covers various health purposes is needed to reveal the new usages and research gaps that emerge in recent years. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide a systematic review of social media uses for health purposes that have been identified in previous studies. METHODS: The researchers searched for peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2006 and 2020 in 12 databases covering medicine, public health, and social science. After coding the articles in terms of publication year, journal area, country, method, social media platform, and social media use for health purposes, the researchers provided a review of social media use for health purposes identified in these articles. RESULTS: This study summarized 10 social media uses for various health purposes by health institutions, health researchers and practitioners, and the public.

METHODS: This cross-sectional, survey-based study collected demographic and exposure data from physical therapists from April to May 2020. All physical therapists working in an inpatient and outpatient care in Italy were eligible. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed among all eligible physical therapists to collect (1) demographic characteristics, (2–3) personal- and work-related exposures, and (4) signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Factors associated with a COVID-19 positive nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) were explored through logistic regression models and multivariate methods. RESULTS: A total of 15,566 respondents completed the survey, with a response rate of 43.3%, achieving high statistical precision (99% CI, 1% type I error). Among physical therapists who received NPS testing, 13.1% (95% CI = 12.1–14.1%) had a positive result, with a peak reached in March 2020 (36%). The top five symptoms were fatigue and tiredness (69.1%), loss of smell (64.5%), aches and pains (60.8%), loss of taste (58.3%), and headache (51.1%). No symptoms were reported by 8.9%. Working in a health care institution [odds ratio (OR) = 7.2; 95% CI = 5.4–9.7], being reallocated to a different unit (OR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.3–2.2) and changing job tasks (OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.2–2.2) increased the risk of being COVID-19 positive. In therapists with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, comorbidities were associated with male sex and age older than 51 years. CONCLUSIONS: During the first wave in Italy, almost 1 out of 7 physical therapists tested positive on the COVID-19 NPS test.

BACKGROUND: COVID‐19 has been listed as an international public health emergency. Clinical first‐line nurses are at a high risk of infection, and they face a lack of experience and inadequate preparation for COVID‐19, leading to physical and psychological disorders. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted from January to February, 2020 at a COVID‐19‐designated hospital in Wuhan, China. Thirty nurses were selected for the study using a purposive sampling method. Data were collected by semi‐structured interviews and analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: Two main categories were defined in the study from the perspective of nurses: negative experiences during clinical first‐line work and positive impacts of clinical first‐line work. Under the first category, two subcategories were included: psychological experiences of clinical first‐line work and difficulties faced during clinical first‐line work. The analysis further yielded two subcategories for the second category: the needs of clinical first‐line work and the impact of clinical first‐line work on professional attitudes.

Reusable masks made from surgical sterilization wrap represent such an innovative approach with social media frequently referring to them as “N95 alternatives.” This material was tested for particle filtration efficiency and breathability to clarify what role they might have in infection prevention and control. METHODS: A heavyweight, double layer sterilization wrap was tested when new and after 2, 4, 6, and 10 autoclave sterilizing cycles and compared with an approved N95 respirator and a surgical mask via testing procedures using a sodium chloride aerosol for N95 efficiency testing similar to 42 CFR 84.181. Pressure testing to indicate breathability was also conducted. RESULTS: The particle filtration efficiency for the sterilization wrap ranged between 58% to 66%, with similar performance when new and after sterilizing cycles. The N95 respirator and surgical mask performed at 95% and 68% respectively. Pressure drops for the sterilization wrap, N95 and surgical mask were 10.4 mmH(2)O, 5.9 mmH(2)O, and 5.1 mmH(2)O, respectively, well below the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health limits of 35 mmH(2)O during initial inhalation and 25 mmH(2)O during initial exhalation.

This review aims to appraise the current evidence for the ADVanced Organ Support (ADVOS) system, a novel device integrating liver, lung, and kidney support with blood detoxification. METHODS: We performed a literature review of the PubMed database to identify human and animal studies evaluating the ADVOS system. RESULTS: In porcine models of acute liver injury and small clinical studies in humans, ADVOS significantly enhanced the elimination of water-soluble and protein-bound toxins and metabolites, including creatinine, ammonia, blood urea nitrogen, and lactate. Cardiovascular parameters (mean arterial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, and cardiac index) and renal function were improved. ADVOS clears carbon dioxide (CO2 ) effectively with rapid correction of pH abnormalities, achieving normalization of CO2 , and bicarbonate levels. In patients with COVID-19 infection, ADVOS enables rapid correction of acid-base disturbance and respiratory acidosis. ADVOS therapy reduces mortality in multi-organ failure and has been shown to be safe with minimal adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: From the small observational studies analyzed, ADVOS demonstrates excellent detoxification of water-soluble and protein-bound substances. In particular, ADVOS permits the correction of metabolic and respiratory acidosis through the fluid-based direct removal of acid and CO2 . ADVOS is associated with significant improvements in hemodynamic and biochemical parameters, a trend toward improved survival in multi-organ failure, and is well-tolerated.

Scan time and file size determine throughput and storage costs, whereas tissue omission during digital capture (“dropouts”) compromises downstream interpretation. We compared how these variables differ across scanners. METHODS: A 212 slide set randomly selected from a gynecologic-gestational pathology practice was used to benchmark scan time, file size, and image completeness. Workflows included the Hamamatsu S210 scanner (operated under default and optimized profiles) and the Leica GT450. Digital tissue dropouts were detected by the aligned overlay of macroscopic glass slide camera images (reference) with images created by the slide scanners whole slide images. RESULTS: File size and scan time were highly correlated within each platform. Differences in GT450, default S210, and optimized S210 performance were seen in average file size (1.4 vs. 2.5 vs. 3.4 GB) and scan time (93 vs. 376 vs. 721 s). Dropouts were seen in 29.5% (186/631) of successful scans overall: from a low of 13.7% (29/212) for the optimized S210 profile, followed by 34.6% (73/211) for the GT450 and 40.4% (84/208) for the default profile S210 profile. Small dislodged fragments, “shards,” were dropped in 22.2% (140/631) of slides, followed by tissue marginalized at the glass slide edges, 6.2% (39/631). “Unique dropouts,” those for which no equivalent appeared elsewhere in the scan, occurred in only three slides. Of these, 67% (2/3) were “floaters” or contaminants from other cases. CONCLUSIONS: Scanning speed and resultant file size vary greatly by scanner type, scanner operation settings, and clinical specimen mix (tissue type, tissue area). Digital image fidelity as measured by tissue dropout frequency and dropout type also varies according to the tissue type and scanner. Dropped tissues very rarely (1/631) represent actual specimen tissues that are not represented elsewhere in the scan, so in most cases cannot alter the diagnosis. Digital pathology platforms vary in their output efficiency and image fidelity to the glass original and should be matched to the intended application.",2022-01-08,"Mutter, George L.; Milstone, David S.; Hwang, David H.; Siegmund, Stephanie; Bruce, Alexander",J Pathol Inform,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/d1f480be9f5e776344c828fb03c4ec485b106e9a.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8794031.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.4103/jpi.jpi_5_21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35136675/,245833364.0

Low-cost optical sensors for PM measurement are desirable for monitoring exposure closer to the personal level and particularly suited for developing spatiotemporally dense city sensor networks. However, questions remain over the accuracy and reliability of the data they produce, particularly regarding the influence of environmental parameters such as humidity and temperature, and with varying PM sources and concentration profiles. In this study, eight units each of five different models of commercially available low-cost optical PM sensors (40 individual sensors in total) were tested under controlled laboratory conditions, against higher-grade instruments for: lower limit of detection, response time, responses to sharp pollution spikes lasting <1 [Formula: see text] , and the impact of differing humidity and PM source. All sensors detected the spikes generated with a varied range of performances depending on the model and presenting different sensitivity mainly to sources of pollution and to size distributions with a lesser impact of humidity. The sensitivity to particle size distribution indicates that the sensors may provide additional information to PM mass concentrations.

Type I interferon (IFN-I) production is impaired and severe cases lead to ARDS and widespread coagulopathy. We propose that COVID-19 pathophysiology is initiated by SARS-CoV-2 gene products, the NSP1 and ORF6 proteins, leading to a catastrophic cascade of failures. These viral components induce signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) dysfunction and compensatory hyperactivation of STAT3. In SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, a positive feedback loop established between STAT3 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) may lead to an escalating cycle of activation in common with the interdependent signaling networks affected in COVID-19. Specifically, PAI-1 upregulation leads to coagulopathy characterized by intravascular thrombi. Overproduced PAI-1 binds to TLR4 on macrophages, inducing the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The recruitment and subsequent activation of innate immune cells within an infected lung drives the destruction of lung architecture, which leads to the infection of regional endothelial cells and produces a hypoxic environment that further stimulates PAI-1 production. Acute lung injury also activates EGFR and leads to the phosphorylation of STAT3. COVID-19 patients’ autopsies frequently exhibit diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and increased hyaluronan (HA) production which also leads to higher levels of PAI-1. COVID-19 risk factors are consistent with this scenario, as PAI-1 levels are increased in hypertension, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and old age. We discuss the possibility of using various approved drugs, or drugs currently in clinical development, to treat COVID-19. This perspective suggests to enhance STAT1 activity and/or inhibit STAT3 functions for COVID-19 treatment. This might derail the escalating STAT3/PAI-1 cycle central to COVID-19.",2020-10-09,"Matsuyama, Toshifumi; Kubli, Shawn P.; Yoshinaga, Steven K.; Pfeffer, Klaus; Mak, Tak W.",Cell Death Differ,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/f96b064af10bf812a172a0a4fcdc7d3ba3d957ee.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7545020.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41418-020-00633-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33037393/,222229874.0

PURPOSE: Letters of recommendation (LORs) are highly regarded components of pharmacy residency applications, as they provide insight into an applicant’s character and capabilities. In other medical fields, differences in language have been reported for letters written for female and male applicants; however, data on gender differences in LORs for pharmacy residency applications are currently lacking. METHODS: LORs for applicants to our institution’s postgraduate year 1 pharmacy residency program for the 2019-2020 academic year were extracted and processed by a natural language processing service. Words within 18 categories were identified and counted for each LOR. Total was also compared. RESULTS: Of the 473 LORs included for analysis, 320 (67.7%) were written for female applicants and 153 (32.3%) were written for male applicants. Approximately two-thirds of all writers were women for both female and male applicants. In comparing letters for women and men, there was a statistically significant difference in the percentage of LORs that contained terms in categories described as gendered, solitary/reserved, and desire. There was no statistically significant difference in total or in the presence of words in other categories such as grindstone, standout, agentic, or communal. When controlling for grade point average, writer gender, duration that the writer knew the applicant, and the writer’s professional position, there were no changes to the statistical findings.

With the objective of identifying skin lesions in patients with suspected COVID-19 and evaluating possible associations with systemic involvement, other infectious agents and coagulation disorders, we carried out a prospective observational study that included all patients that attended our COVID-19 dermatology clinic with a multidisciplinary protocol. A total of 63 patients (mean 34.6 years) were enrolled between May 2020 and February 2021. Overall, 27 patients (42.9%) had a positive COVID-19 test, and 74.6% had COVID-19 clinical signs. The most common skin lesion was maculopapular rash (36.5%), predominantly seen in male (54.2%) and older patients (42 vs. 30 years), followed by chilblain-like lesions (20.6%) in younger patients (13.9 vs. 20.9 years) who were predominantly barefoot at home (69.2%); these patients exhibited a tendency towards a negative COVID-19 test. A total of 12 patients (19.1%) had positive serology for herpesvirus 6 (IgM or IgG). We conclude that the COVID-19-associated skin lesions we observed were similar to those previously described.

Exclusion criteria included age less than 18 years, do not resuscitate/do not intubate documented prior to arrival, advanced directives outlining limitations of care, and inability to calculate baseline modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (mSOFA) score. INTERVENTIONS: ED-based critical care consultation by an early intervention team (EIT) initiated by the primary emergency medicine physician compared with usual practice. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was hospital LOS, and secondary outcomes were hospital mortality, ICU LOS, ventilator-free days, and change in the mSOFA.

The virus spread quickly, particularly in the North of Italy, with three regions (Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna) being the most severely affected. These three regions accounted for >80% of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases when the tight lockdown was established (March 8). These regions include one of Europe's areas of heaviest air pollution, the Po valley. Air pollution has been recently proposed as a possible risk factor of SARS-CoV-2 infection, due to its adverse effect on immunity and to the possibility that polluted air may even carry the virus. We investigated the association between air pollution and subsequent spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection within these regions. We collected NO2 tropospheric levels using satellite data available on the European Space Agency before the lockdown. Using a multivariable restricted cubic spline regression model, we compared NO2 levels with SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence rate at different time points after the lockdown, namely March 8, 22 and April 5, in the 28 provinces of Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia Romagna. We found little association of NO2 levels with SARS-CoV-2 prevalence up to about 130 μmol/m2, while a positive association was evident at higher levels at each time point.

He had not contacted his family for more than 50 hours. The patient lived alone and was a heavy smoker with a history of alcohol abuse. His medical history was otherwise unremarkable, and there was no history of cancer, psoriasis, or rheumatoid arthritis, nor was there a history of methotrexate administration. On presentation to the emergency department, he was mildly hypotensive and was experiencing hypercapnic respiratory failure and acute renal failure with rhabdomyolysis. His toxicology screen was mildly positive for opiates. He received naloxone (Narcan; Emergent) with minimal effect. An unenhanced CT scan of the head was obtained (Fig 1A). Of note, this patient's presentation predated the COVID-19 pandemic. He was admitted to the intensive care unit for decreased level of consciousness and respiratory failure. The decreased level of consciousness was thought to be secondary to seizure, as he developed seizurelike movements prior to intubation, probably in the context of intoxication or alcohol withdrawal. Electroencephalography revealed moderate bilateral cerebral dysfunction and encephalopathy, with no evidence of nonconvulsive seizures. He had a short course of intermittent hemodialysis and was discharged home 8 days later with an appointment for neurology follow-up. At discharge, he was at his cognitive and functional baseline. Approximately 3 weeks later, the patient was brought back to the emergency department for progressive confusion and decrease in balance. He became apathetic with reduced psychomotor activity and was no longer able to perform basic daily activities, such as cooking or bathing. He displayed bizarre behavior, such as staring at a wall for hours, and was somnolent, irritable, and inattentive. He eventually became incontinent of urine and stool. Results of a neurologic examination of the cranial nerves, motor function, sensation, and reflexes were normal. The results of blood work-up were grossly normal, and the results of an extensive toxicology work-up were negative. Repeat head CT was performed (Fig 1B).

In this study, we investigated the effect of NAFLD on satellite cell (SC) content and skeletal muscle repair. METHODS Male CD-1 mice fed a choline-deficient diet for 4 wk were used as an NAFLD model. We performed histologic and mRNA expression analyses, immunochemical staining with single muscle fibers to assess the effect of NAFLD on muscle Pax7+ SCs, and muscle regeneration by intramuscular injection of cardiotoxin. RESULTS We found that the total number of Pax7+ SCs in the extensor digitorum longus and tibialis anterior muscles of mice with NAFLD was significantly decreased when compared with that in the control group, in which the depletion of the SC pool possibly impaired muscle regeneration, as evidenced by the smaller size of the regenerating myofibers. Importantly, we found that NAFLD significantly impaired the differentiation ability of SCs, as shown by a decreased number of SCs expressing a myogenic marker, MyoD. Finally, this study indicated that molecular mechanisms underlying a decline in SC numbers may be attributed to the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α [TNFα]) and an oxidative stress marker (NADPH oxidase-2 [NOX2\) in mice with NAFLD. CONCLUSIONS The findings demonstrate that a decrease in SC content in the skeletal muscle is an important factor that contributes to muscle wasting in NAFLD.

Severe patients progressed rapidly to Critical condition including multi-organ failure and even death. Identification of early predictive factors is urgently necessary to facilitate appropriate intensive care. METHODSWe included all patient admitted to Wuhan Union Hospital and treated by the supportive medical team of Beijing Tongren Hospital as of March 20, 2020. Indicators of injuries for multiple organs, including the heart, kidney and liver, and glucose homeostasis were specifically analyzed for predicting primary outcomes (an intensive care unit (ICU) or death). RESULTSThe data of 120 patients with a severity equal to or greater than Moderate, discharged or died were extracted. After excluding patients with history of diabetes, chronic heart, kidney, and liver disease, 69 patients were included in the final analysis. There were 26 cases with primary outcomes including 16 deaths. Univariable analysis indicated that fasting blood glucose (FBG), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH), creatine kinase and creatinine were associated with primary outcomes and death. Among patients with primary outcomes, although FBG levels were much higher on admission, they dramatically decreased subsequently, while in deceased patients they increased continuously. Multivariable Cox regression indicated that FBG[â¥]7mmol/L was the only independent predictor for death (HR = 3.75, 95% CI 1.26-11.15).

In this article, we use qualitative data from an Australian national survey to examine the self-care strategies frontline healthcare professionals employed to manage their mental health and wellbeing during the crisis. Findings reveal how healthcare workers sought to adjust to disruption by adopting new self-care practices and mindsets, while encountering numerous personal and professional struggles that undermined their capacity for self-care. Feeling socially connected and valued were critical dimensions of caring for self, illustrating the importance of locating self-care in the social domain. These findings, we argue, highlight the need to expand conceptions of self-care away from those that focus primarily on the individual towards approaches that situate self care as collective and relational.",2021-12-07,"Lewis, Sophie; Willis, Karen; Bismark, Marie; Smallwood, Natasha",SSM Ment Health,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/579de3671a151c549b28d003cfd5d8bb9b3d56e4.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8660664.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34913042/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmmh.2021.100053; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666560321000530?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666560321000530,245007336.0

Few reports exist in Latin America, a current epicenter of transmission. Here, we aim to describe the epidemiology and outcomes associated with COVID-19 in Honduras. METHODS: Baseline clinical and epidemiological information of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed cases detected between March 17(th)-May 4(th) in the San Pedro Sula Metropolitan area was collected, and, for hospitalized cases, clinical data was abstracted. Logistic regression models were fit to determine factors associated with hospitalization. RESULTS: 877 COVID-19 cases were identified of which 25% (n=220) were hospitalized. The 19-44-year age group (57.8%) and males (61.3%) were predominant in overall COVID-19 cases. 34% of the cases (n=299) had at least one pre-existing medical condition. Individuals aged 45-69 years [aOR= 4.05, 95% CI: 2.85-5.76], ≥70 years [aOR= 9.12, 95% CI:5.24-15.86], of male sex [aOR =1.72, CI 95%: 1.21-2.44] and those with a pre-existing condition [aOR= 2.12, 95% CI: 1.43-3.14] had a higher odd of hospitalization. Fifty percent of inpatients were hospitalized more than 7 days. Median length of hospitalization was 13 days [IQR: 8-29] among individuals aged 19-44 years, and 17 days [IQR: 11-24.6] among those aged 45-69. Forty-two percent of the fatal cases occurred among adults under 60 years old.

Therefore, the risk of a trans-species spreading event between domestic cats and humans is ever-present. Shortly after the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its rapid spread around the world, the role of domestic cats in the transmission cycle was questioned. In the present study, the first large-scale survey of antibody occurrence in the domestic cat population in Germany was conducted, in order to assess the incidence of naturally occurring human to cat transmission of SARS-CoV-2. A total of 920 serum samples, which were collected from April to September of 2020, were screened by an indirect multispecies ELISA. Positive samples were verified using an indirect immunofluorescence test (iIFT) and additionally tested for neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, serum samples were screened for antibodies against feline coronavirus (FCoV), in order to rule out cross-reactivity in the described test systems. Overall, 0.69% (6/920) of serum samples were found to be positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by ELISA and iIFT. Two of these reactive sera also displayed neutralizing antibodies. No cross-reactivity with FCoV-specific antibodies was observed. The finding of SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive serum samples in the domestic cat population of Germany, during a period when the incidence of human infection in the country was still rather low, indicates that human-to-cat transmission of SARS-CoV-2 happens, but there is no indication of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in cats.",2020-12-17,"Michelitsch, Anna; Hoffmann, Donata; Wernike, Kerstin; Beer, Martin",Vaccines (Basel),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/87d20d66f2f4659d26c76937bc95a4af4dd59012.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7766304.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33348613/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8040772,229352860.0

Sudden onset loss of smell and/or taste has been increasingly reported as a symptom of COVID-19. However, prevalence of these symptoms, and its severity varies widely between studies, with little data on its duration and recovery rate. Since this significantly impacts the quality of life of patients, there is a need for a study to provide insight into the loss of smell or taste in terms of its correlation with other upper respiratory tract symptoms, natural history and resolution rates. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 718 mild to moderately symptomatic adult patients (≥ 18 years), admitted consecutively to Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), Odisha, India between June 25 and July 24, 2020, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal and throat swabs. Prevalence, severity, duration and factors associated with altered smell or taste sensation, and their follow-up were recorded. RESULTS: Of the 718 patients included in the study at baseline [563 (78%) men; median age 34 years], 101 (14%) patients experienced either altered smell or taste, with 52 (7%) experiencing both altered smell and taste. Seventy-seven (10.7%) patients had altered smell and 76 patients had altered taste (10.5%). Of these, 71 (92%) and 73 (96%) regained their sense of smell and taste, respectively, by 14 days after their swab tested positive. Presence of fever (OR = 5.4, 95% CI = 2.7–10.6, p < 0.001), cough (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.2–4.2, p = 0.009) and nasal obstruction (OR = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.4–6.7, p = 0.006) were independently associated with increased likelihood of experiencing both altered taste and smell in multivariable models. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of altered smell and taste in Indians was much lower compared to Europeans and similar to East Asians. Majority regained these senses by 2 weeks.

Individuals living in impoverished crowded settings may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19-related stressors. How substantially marginalized groups like impoverished urban-dwelling individuals have been impacted during this pandemic is poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate the associated factors of financial concerns and symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the COVID-19 pandemic among impoverished urban-dwelling individuals residing in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between August and September 2020 using face-to-face interviews in six disadvantaged neighborhoods (“slums”) in Dhaka. Individuals were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire consisting of questions assessing socio-demographics, lifestyle, financial well-being relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, depression, and PTSD. Results: Four-hundred-and-thirty-five individuals (male = 54.7%; mean age = 45.0 ± 12.0 years; age range = 18–85 years) participated. Most (96.3%) reported that their household income decreased due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Factors associated with decreased household incomes included female gender, primary education, joblessness, food scarcity and depression. Depression symptoms were linked to female gender, joblessness, divorce, living in a joint family, excessive sleep and smoking. Low incomes, excessive sleep, joblessness and food scarcity were positively associated with PTSD symptoms. In contrast, less sleep appeared protective against PTSD.

It is important for the development of many RNA virus-infected diseases. The primary factors through which the infection becomes inflammation involve inflammasome. Inflammasomes are proteins complex that the activation is responsive to specific pathogens, host cell damage, and other environmental stimuli. Inflammasomes bring about the maturation of various pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-18 and IL-1β in order to mediate the innate immune defense mechanisms. Many RNA viruses and their components, such as encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) 2B viroporin, the viral RNA of hepatitis C virus, the influenza virus M2 viroporin, the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) small hydrophobic (SH) viroporin, and the human rhinovirus (HRV) 2B viroporin can activate the Nod-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome to influence the inflammatory response.

It increases morbidity and mortality, and is associated with high economic costs due to its health care burden. Infections with multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria also have substantial implications on clinical and economic outcomes. Moreover, increased indiscriminate use of antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic will heighten bacterial resistance and ultimately lead to more deaths. This review highlights AMR’s scale and consequences, the importance, and implications of an antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) to fight resistance and protect global health. Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS), an organizational or system-wide health-care strategy, is designed to promote, improve, monitor, and evaluate the rational use of antimicrobials to preserve their future effectiveness, along with the promotion and protection of public health. ASP has been very successful in promoting antimicrobials’ appropriate use by implementing evidence-based interventions.

Here we provide data regarding our experience with managing patients on chronic anticoagulants, including warfarin, within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large integrated healthcare delivery system serving more than 4 million patients. Aim To identify whether being on anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents correlates with an increased risk of contracting COVID-19. Methods We identified patients within KPNC electronic medical records on either warfarin, direct oral anticoagulation (DOAC) and/or antiplatelet agents between February 25 and July 3, 2020, as well as a randomly identified control group of patients not taking anticoagulation or antiplatelet. We looked for a correlation between taking anticoagulation and antiplatelets with the risk of testing positive for COVID-19. Results/Conclusions Among 188,438 patients on chronic anticoagulants or antiplatelets and 188,438 controls, 1,029 patients tested positive for COVID-19 during the study period. Being on chronic anticoagulants or antiplatelets was not associated with increased risk for a positive test. Patients on warfarin (N=30,242) also had no increased risk of developing COVID-19 compared to patients not on anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy (odds ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.64-1.17). The time in the therapeutic range (TTR) of patients on warfarin during the COVID-19 pandemic remained near 72%, consistent with prior TTR, demonstrating persistent efficacy of anticoagulation despite measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission. Our data demonstrates the safety of continuing chronic warfarin in patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: This online survey study investigated mental health, subjective experience, and behaviour (health, learning/teaching) among university students studying in Egypt or Germany shortly after the first pandemic lockdown in May 2020. Psychological assessment included stable personality traits, self-concept and state-like psychological variables related to (a) mental health (depression, anxiety), (b) pandemic threat perception (feelings during the pandemic, perceived difficulties in describing, identifying, expressing emotions), (c) health (e.g., worries about health, bodily symptoms) and behaviour including perceived difficulties in learning. Assessment methods comprised self-report questions, standardized psychological scales, psychological questionnaires, and linguistic self-report measures. Data analysis comprised descriptive analysis of mental health, linguistic analysis of self-concept, personality and feelings, as well as correlational analysis and machine learning. N = 220 (107 women, 112 men, 1 = other) studying in Egypt or Germany provided answers to all psychological questionnaires and survey items. RESULTS: Mean state and trait anxiety scores were significantly above the cut off scores that distinguish between high versus low anxious subjects. Depressive symptoms were reported by 51.82% of the student sample, the mean score was significantly above the screening cut off score for risk of depression. Worries about health (mental and physical health) and perceived difficulties in identifying feelings, and difficulties in learning behaviour relative to before the pandemic were also significant. No negative self-concept was found in the linguistic descriptions of the participants, whereas linguistic descriptions of feelings during the pandemic revealed a negativity bias in emotion perception. Machine learning (exploratory) predicted personality from the self-report data suggesting relations between personality and subjective experience that were not captured by descriptive or correlative data analytics alone. CONCLUSION: Despite small sample sizes, this multimethod survey provides important insight into mental health of university students studying in Egypt or Germany and how they perceived the first COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in May 2020. The results should be continued with larger samples to help develop psychological interventions that support university students across countries and cultures to stay psychologically resilient during the pandemic.

The static threshold used two or three standard deviations (SDs) above the mean hepatitis A incidence in 2017–2019, and a cumulative summation (CuSum2) threshold used three SDs above the mean of the preceding seven months. These thresholds were applied to hepatitis A data for 2020. From 2017 to 2020, the mean incidence of hepatitis A IgM was 4.06/100,000 and ranged from 4.23 to 4.85/100,000 per year. Hepatitis A incidence was highest in the Western Cape province (WCP) (7.00–10.92/100,000 per year). The highest incidence was in the 1–9-year-olds. The incidence of hepatitis A in 2020 exceeded the static threshold in two districts of the WCP: Cape Winelands in January and Overberg district in August.

This aesthetic labor is presented to women as freely chosen and empowering. Brazilian waxing is exemplary aesthetic labor directed at the self. Academic literature on aesthetic labor in general, and Brazilian waxing in particular, looks at white and middle-class women, as this category of women is considered the putative subject of postfeminism. Little attention is paid to racialized women from the global south who perform aesthetic labor on other women’s bodies in the global north. In this paper, I draw on my ethnographic study of two beauty salons in London run by South Asian women to argue that these South Asian beauticians are postfeminist subjects as well. The aim of challenging the putative subject of postfeminism, using the example of Brazilian waxing, is not merely to include South Asian women in the discourse, but to advance a transnational theorization of postfeminism.

In response to these concerns, healthcare systems and organisations rapidly established staff support and wellbeing programmes. While there is emerging literature related to the effectiveness of such interventions, what is less well understood and evaluated is the evidence base regarding how such programmes are implemented; what supports and hinders their implementation; and how or if they are maintained following the initial acute phase of the pandemic. This study addresses this gap by studying the implementation process of COVID-19-related staff wellbeing programmes in the three UK NHS Trusts that make up one of Europe’s largest academic health sciences centres, King’s Health Partners. METHODS: We will conduct a prospective, cross-sectional descriptive study using qualitative research methods and non-probability purposive sampling to identify a study participant group representative of the population and implementation activity of interest. We will conduct semi-structured interviews of between 30 min and 1 h. We will identify theory-driven elements in the dataset using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (barriers and drivers), Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment Framework (timeline/chronology/evolution of the implementation and different issues at different times) and Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (implementation strategies). We will then identify indicators of these constructs within the dataset and report them, as well as their inter-relationships. DISCUSSION: Through this study, we hope to better understand what factors hindered and enabled the implementation of three inter-linked staff support and wellbeing programmes and how/to what extent have these programmes been sustained.

COVID-19 Vaccine Perceptions in Adults from Greater Nashville Tennessee,10.1093/ofid/ofab466.779,PMC8644308,,cc-by,"BACKGROUND: In December 2020, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were made available to healthcare workers and soon thereafter offered to the general public according to age and risk of severe illness. Despite widespread access, vaccination rates vary by region, with Tennessee ranking lower than the national average. Therefore, we aimed to survey adults in greater Nashville, TN regarding SARS-CoV-2 vaccine perceptions. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of an ongoing longitudinal cohort of individuals with confirmed and/or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and their household contacts with enrollment onset in March 2020. For this analysis, individuals were included if they were ≥ 18 years and available for a one-year follow-up visit. At the one-year visit individuals completed a survey about vaccine preferences, beliefs and risks. Demographic and social characteristics were collected at enrollment. Individuals were considered vaccinated if they had received at least one dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine under FDA emergency use authorization. Vaccine perceptions were compared by SARS-CoV-2-infection and vaccination status using Pearson’s chi-squared, alpha=5%. RESULTS: Between April-May 2021, 115 individuals completed the one-year follow-up. Table 1 includes sociodemographic characteristics of adults, of which the majority were vaccinated and were unemployed or in non-essential occupations. Most individuals agreed the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine can prevent infection and hospitalization (Figure 1A & B). Unvaccinated participants more often agreed that those who contracted SARS-CoV-2 should not receive the vaccine (30%), whereas vaccinated persons less often agreed (11%, p< 0.001) (Figure 1A). Additionally, 44% of unvaccinated individuals were neutral or disagreed that benefits of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination outweighed the illness risk, compared to 10% in the vaccinated group, p=0.001 (Figure 1A). Minimal differences of vaccine perceptions were observed between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative adults (Figure 1B). Table 1. Sociodemographic Characteristics of Adults [Image: see text] Figure 1.

In critically ill patients with COVID-19, multiorgan failure including acute kidney injury (AKI) is common and is associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity. This review focuses briefly on the epidemiology and pathophysiology of COVID-19 associated AKI as well as options for management. RECENT FINDINGS: The risk factors for AKI are common to both noncovid-related AKI and COVID-19 associated AKI. Kidney injury in COVID-19 associated AKI may arise through several mechanisms, including not only direct effects on the kidney leading to tubular injury but also through the effects of treatment of multiorgan failure complicating infection. During surge conditions, the use of kidney replacement therapy has embraced all modalities including the use of peritoneal dialysis. The use of blood purification techniques has been proposed, but to date, the results are variable. SUMMARY: COVID-19 associated AKI is common, affecting approximately a quarter of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

Although the leading causes of these infections are already known, risk prediction models can be used to identify unexpected cases. This study aims to investigate whether or not it is possible to build multivariate models to predict BSI and RESP events. METHODS: Univariate and multivariate analysis using multiple logistic regression models were built to predict BSI and RESP events. ROC curve analysis was used to validate each model. Independent variables: 29 quantitative parameters and 131 categorical variables. BSI and RESP were identified using Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency protocols with data collected between January and November 2020 from a medical-surgical ICU in a Brazilian Hospital. Definitions: if an infection is 5% or less likely to occur according to the model used and it eventually occurs, it will be classified as “unexpected”, or else, if an infection is 10% or less likely to occur, it will be classified as “probably unexpected”. Otherwise, infections will be classified as “expected”. Patients with a 30% or more risk for BSI or RESP will be classified as “high risk”. RESULTS: A total of 1,171 patients were accessed: 70 patients with BSI (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1%-5%), 66 patients with RESP (95% CI, 2.9%-4.7%), 235 deaths (95% CI, 11.8%-14.9%). Of the 160 potential risk factors evaluated, logistic models for BSI and RESP identified respectively five and seven predictors (Tables 1 and 2, and Figure 1). Patients admitted to the ICU with Covid-19 had a three fold BSI risk and five times more RESP risk than patients without this diagnosis. Table 1.

[Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The built models make possible the identification of the expected infections and the unexpected ones. Three main course of actions can be taken using these models and associated data: (1) Before the occurrence of BSI and RESP: to place high risk patients under more rigorous infection surveillance. (2) After the occurrence of BSI or RESP: to investigate “unexpected” infections. (3) At discharge: to identify high risk patients with no infections for further studies.

The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of non-pharmacological initiatives (NPI) against COVID-19 on the number of hospitalizations due to pediatric acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of pediatric hospitalizations in Porto Alegre, Brazil. We analyzed the monthly incidence of hospital admissions from 2018 to 2020 due to ARIs included in the study. The time series was divided into the period before introducing NPI (2018 and 2019), and the period when NPI were running (2020). We compared means between the years with Student's t-test. The Dickey-Fuller test was used for secular trend analysis. For seasonality, Fischer's G test was performed. Dynamic linear univariate and multivariate models were used to estimate the association between the predictors (the introduction of NPI, secular trend, and seasonality) and outcome (the incidence of ARI admissions). For the statistical analysis, the cut-off probability for rejecting the null hypothesis was defined as < 5%. RESULTS: From 2018 to 2020, 10,109 hospital admissions were due to the respiratory causes included in this study. There was a significant decrease in 2020 in the mean incidence of the ARIs studied compared with 2018 and 2019. The number of hospitalizations due to respiratory diseases in children decreased by 64% for asthma and 93% for bronchiolitis. A secular trend of monthly admissions rates due to ARIs was only observed in the laryngotracheitis data (p = 0.485), but seasonality was detected in all analyses. According to the univariate and multivariate analysis, the introduction of NPI was associated with a decrease in the incidence of ARI admissions. CONCLUSION: There was a significant reduction in hospital admissions due to ARIs in children. Our data suggest a significant impact of NPI on reducing the spread of viruses associated with ARIs in children. These results support respiratory illness prevention strategies.",2021-04-26,"Chiapinotto, Sabrina; Sarria, Edgar E.; Mocelin, Helena T.; Mattiello, Rita; Lima, João A.B.; Fischer, Gilberto B.",Paediatr Respir Rev,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/674cf8a7607fda0f9b68648a58b356482e507217.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8074521.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34016531/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prrv.2021.04.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526054221000269?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1526054221000269,233401331.0

Here, we confirmed that hypoxic precondition could induce enhanced secretion of exosomes from stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs) via comprehensive proteomics analysis, and the corresponding hypoxic exosomes (H-Exo) exhibited superior potential in promoting cellular angiogenesis and osteogenesis via the significant up-regulation in focal adhesion, VEGF signaling pathway, and thyroid hormone synthesis. Then, we developed a platform technology enabling the effective delivery of hypoxic exosomes with sustained release kinetics to irregular-shaped bone defects via injection. This platform is based on a simple adsorbing technique, where exosomes are adsorbed onto the surface of injectable porous poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microspheres with bioinspired polydopamine (PDA) coating (PMS-PDA microspheres). The PMS-PDA microspheres could effectively adsorb exosomes, show sustained release of H-Exo for 21 days with high bioactivity, and induce vascularized bone regeneration in 5-mm rat calvarial defect. These findings indicate that the hypoxic precondition and PMS-PDA porous microsphere-based exosome delivery are efficient in inducing tissue regeneration, hence facilitating the clinical translation of exosome-based therapy.",2022,"Gao, Yike; Yuan, Zuoying; Yuan, Xiaojing; Wan, Zhuo; Yu, Yingjie; Zhan, Qi; Zhao, Yuming; Han, Jianmin; Huang, Jianyong; Xiong, Chunyang; Cai, Qing",Bioact Mater,,#mdl-35386817,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bioactmat.2022.01.041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35386817/,246520706.0

Its prevalence among individuals with clinical suspicion of fungal rhinosinusitis has been reported in approximately 20% in subtropical populations, unlike North America with a prevalence of 0.5%. It is typically associated with Aspergillus flavus and the presence of noncaseating granulomas or Langerhans giant cells on histopathologic examination. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case of a patient with clinical history of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection and development of intense cephalalgia, visual impairment, palpebral ptosis, and limitation of extraocular movements. MRI demonstrated the presence of opacification of paranasal sinuses, and a left intraconal abscess. A surgical endoscopic approach was performed and histopathologic examination revealed frontal GCIFR and maxillary fungus ball. Treatment with IV azoles provided adequate clinical response. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: The spectrum of the fungal rhinosinusitis disease is not clear. However, non-invasive fungal rhinosinusitis is not often found concomitantly with invasive types. GCIFR typically manifests with an indolent and gradual progression at early stages. Advanced stages can exhibit orbital and intracranial involvement leading to visual impairment, frequent relapses, and a poor prognosis. A higher incidence of invasive fungal rhinosinusitis has been reported in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection despite an unremarkable medical history, associated with immune dysregulation. CONCLUSION: GCIFR is a rare condition with few cases reported in America. Because of its uncommonness, its diagnosis is often delayed leading to increased morbidity and mortality.",2021-12-02,"Treviño-Gonzalez, Jose Luis; Santos-Santillana, Karla Marisol; Maldonado-Chapa, Felix; Morales-Del Angel, Josefina Alejandra; Gomez-Castillo, Paola; Cortes-Ponce, Jose Rosmal",Ann Med Surg (Lond),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/96fd9bcc269abf4e0ef2cb0197b1bd8a0b7bd745.json; document_parses/pdf_json/29d8ad79a05b05243ed74d81e8c069eb893738df.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8636311.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2021.103129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34873446/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2049080121010797; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2049080121010797?v=s5,244775917.0

We are conducting an observational cohort study to describe Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) therapy, outcomes, and safety. Methods: In this prospective, longitudinal, descriptive cohort study, we will observe participants with symptoms related to COVID-19 who consent to participate in telehealth visits and receive individualized CHM. All participants are asked to obtain a COVID-19 test. Licensed practitioners with at least 20 years' CHM practice experience will determine the number of telehealth consultations necessary for each participant. All participants are prescribed individualized CHM dispensed either as raw herbs to be decocted at home or granules. Follow-up at 24- and 48-hours after each telehealth visit will provide clinicians with information to determine if an additional telehealth consultation is necessary. Follow-up is at 3, 6, and 12 months. Results: The study is registered ClinicalTrials.gov and currently enrolling. Fifty-six participants have enrolled to date: 35 (63%) are female and 21 (37%) male;45.83 average age (range 22-69). In total, 191 consultations were administered with an average of 3.35 per participant (range 1-9). In the acute phase of illness, the primary symptom reported was fever/chills (23%), fatigue (16%), and sore throat (13%). All but one participant with acute symptoms (n=48) did not progress to long-haul COVID. All long-haul COVID participants (n=7) recovered. No adverse events occurred related to the intervention. One patient was referred to the emergency room out of caution when symptoms did not adequately improve after the initial consult for evaluation. Conclusion: Describing individualized CHM treatment as a potential COVID-19 therapy will provide vital preliminary feasibility, acceptability, tolerability, effectiveness, and safety data. Findings from our study will inform future controlled trials of individualized CHM therapy for symptoms possibly related to COVID-19.
