Using a combination of random PCR amplification, plasmid subcloning, and subsequent DNA sequencing, we identified bocavirus-related sequences in 9 out of 17 porcine stool samples. Through primer walking, we successfully sequenced the nearly complete genomes of two distinct bocaviruses, provisionally named porcine bocavirus 1 isolate H18 (PBoV1-H18) and porcine bocavirus 2 isolate A6 (PBoV2-A6). Notably, these two viruses exhibited a substantial 51.8% difference in their NS1 protein. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that PBoV1-H18 showed a close relationship with a âˆ¼2 Kb central region of a porcine bocavirus-like virus (PBo-LikeV) identified in Sweden in 2009. On the other hand, PBoV2-A6 demonstrated close similarity to the porcine bocavirus genomes PBoV-1 and PBoV2 from China, reported in 2010. In an extensive survey involving 340 fecal samples collected from asymptomatic swine of various ages in five Chinese provinces, the prevalence of PBoV1-H18 and PBoV2-A6 related viruses ranged from 45% to 75% and 55% to 70%, respectively, with 30% to 47% of the pigs exhibiting co-infections. The PBoV1-A6 related strains displayed high conservation, while the PBoV2-H18 related strains showcased greater diversity, forming two distinct genotypes corresponding to the previously identified PBoV1 and PBoV2. In addition to the recently reported partial bocavirus genomes labeled V6 and V7, this brings the total count of major porcine bocavirus clades to three. Future investigations will be necessary to unravel the potential pathogenic impact of these diverse bocaviruses, whether acting independently or in conjunction with other porcine viruses.
